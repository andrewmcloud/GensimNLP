Abstract
The challenge against continued changes in threat scenarios and threat characteristics warrant a
forward-looking solution defeating the enemies intent. The threat space can encompass a broad
range covering chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats, commonly called
CBRNE threats. A layered-defense architecture including remotely operated screening technologies
through unmanned autonomous systems, stand-off technologies, threat deterrent objects and
checkpoint screening supports the basic structure of the technology solution toolbox. This article
focuses at developing the principles of designing an effective checkpoint screening system.

1. Introduction
Due to the increasing interrelationships in the worlds socio-economic system there exists an
underlying common international thread. In order to establish a safe world a global security
solution against the threat of terrorism is needed. An apparently disjointed event in a remote
place can trigger a major catastrophic problem across the globe. The global interconnectivity
warrants developing an appropriate policy and technology solution to ensure this safety that is
able to readily respond as soon as any clue/signature for an undesirable event erupts in any part
of the world. The threat space covers a broad range of hazards including chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear and explosive threats, commonly called CBRNE threats.
An effective countermeasure solution requires many disparate components, namely,
technology, standards, operational strategy, interoperability considerations, adaptive capabilities

for diverse threat scenarios, and above all, policy issues including privacy, information sharing,
interagency and intergovernmental coordination, health and flow of commerce. Robustness,
rapid deployment and cost constitute the major factors for an effective deployment and a good
return of investment. A layered-defense architecture including surveillance technologies,
remotely operated screening technologies through unmanned autonomous systems, stand-off
technologies, various threat deterrent objects and finally, a check-point screening supports the
basic structure of the technology solution toolbox. An effective solution requires consideration of
the following key process steps:
(i)

Develop a systems level approach that is agile, quickly adaptable to evolving threat
scenarios, and strategize technology development based on end-users requirements;

(ii)

Implement a spiral technology development: Technology assessment toolbox will
guide determination of the measures of effectiveness and associated risks;

(iii)

Build a well-knit communication protocol threading the policy makers, end users and
technology developers.

Along with addressing the overall CBRNE threat problem and potential technology solution
this article focuses on the key process steps for developing a check-point screening system.
While the basic framework can be applied to a broad class of CBRNE threats, the process steps
discussed here will emphasize challenging people-borne and/or vehicle-borne threats, especially
Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

2. Key Process Steps for Technology Solution against Threats
The technology solution for CBRNE threats requires an a priori knowledge of the threat
characteristics. The goal is to develop the corresponding technology solution for detection and

identification of the threat signatures. An effective process will identify technology modalities
that can combat multiple threat scenarios from the fundamental science standpoint. If the
solution requires completely independent technology components for combating different pieces
of the CBRNE threats, then the full integrated solution requires a large technology resource and
thereby, an enormous investment. Identifying some common threads in the possible technology
solutions across the threat space will reduce the overall resource load. Figure 1 schematically
illustrates this basic concept. Note that the integrated technology solution for CBRNE gets
reduced to a tighter space (smaller circle encompassing all components of CBRNE) with
increasing common threads of the technology requirements for the individual threat components.
A thorough understanding of the overall threat characteristics and their corresponding
technology solution is required to build an effective overall solution.

Figure 1. Notice a large circle on the left hand side encompassing a CBRNE technology solution when each
group of technology solutions only combats a specific group of threats, i.e., there is no intersection among
technologies for C, B, R, N, and E threats. The overall requirement is significantly reduced if some common
technology solutions are recognized  see intersections among threat circles and an overall reduction of the
outer circle. An ideal solution will minimize the area of the outer circle encompassing all threat solution
components.

An important consideration for the integrated technology solution is the performance
versus cost trade-off analysis. While developing new technology components or bringing in

matured COTS technology for a field solution, it is important to determine the overall
enhancement of the performance metrics. This is often judged by measures of effectiveness
(MOE). Attaining system MOEs of practical utility is constrained by the available resources,
especially funds. Figure 2 gives a conceptual illustration identifying the point up to which the
investment has the most significant impact. This figure is drawn in relative scale. Clearly, the
most effective performance against investment is obtained around the knee of the curve. This
method is applicable to selecting, designing and developing the subcomponents of the overall
technology solution as well.

A. Layered-defense Technology Architecture Leading to Check-Point Screening
With the aforementioned strategic approach the next step is to design the architecture for
implementing technology. In this regard, it must be recognized that no single technology will
provide a full-proof solution; a layered defense architecture is expected to provide an effective
solution.
A conceptual system highlighting the principal technology components of a layered
defense architecture is shown in Fig.3. Notice the coupling among many disparate elements of
the system, namely, surveillance, remote/stand-off screening, check-point screening, algorithms,

CONOPs, and decision making. The critical step is to recognize the threat as rapidly and as early
as possible and as far removed from the potential terrorists/enemies targets as possible.

Figure 3. A layered-defense technology architecture including a surveillance system, remotely operated/standoff screening system and a check-point screening system. Several illustrative technology candidates are
highlighted. Many of these technology components are suitable for multiple threat domains. CCTV: Closedcircuit TV; NIR: Near infra-red; IR: Infra-red; mmW: millimeter wave; LIBS: Laser-induced breakdown
spectroscopy; XRBS: X-ray backscattering; IMS: Ion Mobility Spectrometry; DMS: Differential Mobility
Spectrometry; MS: Mass spectrometry; AFP: Amplifying Fluorescent Polymers; XRT: X-ray transmission;
XRD: X-ray diffraction; XRCT: X-ray computed tomography; PFNA: Pulsed fast neutron analysis.

This basic technology framework in Fig. 3 can be applied to multiple threats in the CBRNE
domain, for example, toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs),
biological warfare agents (BWA), radiological and nuclear devices, and above all, people-borne,
vehicle-borne and leave-behind IEDs.
Several literatures describe the technologies for different threat domains [1-3]. The
primary issue is to align multiple technology components in an ordered manner so that the

threats are rapidly (~ real time) detected with very low false alarm rates. Ideally, 100% detection
and 0% false alarm rates are desirable. An effective approach is to identify and implement
orthogonal sensing modalities. The data analysis and decision making protocol requires a data
fusion scheme which acts as the central brainpower of the overall architecture. Several literatures
[4,5] address this problem and develop the basic guidelines to implement this approach. The data
analysis follows a variety of schemes, such as Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer algorithm,
neural networks, voting schemes, fuzzy logic, and support vector machines. The formulation of
the Bayes algorithm updates the decision making score through a probabilistic calculation in the
following manner.

Here, P(A|B) is the condition probability of the event A, given the occurrence of the event B.
Likewise, P(B|A) can be defined as well. The conditional probability is also called the posterior
probability due to its dependence on the specified value of B. P(A) and P(B) are, respectively,
the a priori probabilities of A and B. A denotes the complementary event of A. The Bayesian
scheme can be applicable to many circumstances, and it probabilistically extrapolates and makes
inference from the data in the context of prior statistical knowledge.

B. Checkpoint Screening
As shown in Fig. 3 the information from the outside screening layers, namely, surveillance and
remotely-operated/stand-off screening feeds the check-point screening technology that acts as the
secondary confirmatory screening system. The technology components in the check-point
screening have a short range, from approximately a few centimeters to meters. These technology

components are usually very sensitive to the extent that even a very trace amount of materials
(parts per billion to parts per trillion) can be detected. They also have good selectivity and can
identify threat signatures with material composition characteristics. Its extremely important that
these technology components operate almost in real time. Figure 3 highlights some examples of
technologies relevant to check-point screening. An illustration combining orthogonal
technologies and achieving high probability of detection with low false alarm rates is included in
Figure 4. Here, the characteristic spectra from an IMS are combined with the corresponding
Raman spectra  three explosive materials, namely, TNT, RDX and HMX, and two nonexplosive materials, namely, di-nitro-o-cresol (DNOC) and musk ambrette are considered here.
Although the IMS spectra for TNT, RDX and DNOC, and HMX and musk ambrette yield close
mobility values, the two-dimensional spectral plot can distinctly resolve the materials. The
argument can be similarly built against the Raman spectra alone. The Raman signatures along
with IMS provide a unique capability for identification of the materials. The illustration in Fig. 4
supports combining orthogonal sensor modalities for enhanced system performance.

In order to design and develop an efficient check-point screening system it is important to
integrate multiple technologies. Although there has been a significant progress in screening
technologies with good measures of performance (MOP) of the individual technology
component in a controlled environment, such as in the laboratory, the requirements for a credible
technology solution becomes formidable in an open environment. Clutter from the background,
wide variation in environmental conditions, and targets in a crowded environment constitute
some of the challenges to design a reliable technology solution. An orthogonal hybrid sensor
modality, as illustrated in Figure 4, is a means to overcome the performance limitations due to
clutters. Having developed robust individual technology components the next task is to design
and build an integrated system, for example, an integrated check-point system comprising
multiple technology elements and associated CONOPs. The information from this integrated
system strengthens the decision making process and achieve the mission goals. The MoPs of
different technology components are appropriately weighted, combined and finally linked to the
measures of effectiveness (MoE) that are set by the mission objectives. Figure 5 below gives a
schematic diagram highlighting the notion of funneling the information from different disparate
technology components at the checkpoint that challenge different threat pieces, namely, people
and baggage-borne devices. In order to achieve an effective countermeasure solution the
checkpoint needs to be optimally utilized for secondary screening and confirmation. The
checkpoint needs to be linked to the previous components, namely, surveillance and stand-off
screening system as shown in Fig. 2. In fact, the a priori input to the checkpoint is obtained from
those components ahead of the checkpoint, and the information is updated following the
aforementioned Bayes analysis. The ultimate goal is to skim out the technology output and use

them to a decision making parameter that effectively triggers the countermeasures. The
mathematical construct for this comes from optimizing the MoPs and MoEs.
