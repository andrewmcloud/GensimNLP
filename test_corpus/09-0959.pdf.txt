Why Adaptive Airspace?
 Todays airspace boundaries are drawn around the
routes that were designed years ago
 New technologies are redrawing the routes
 Communication/navigation/surveillance
 Automation systems
 Aircraft performance

 Demand increases, delay increases
 Airspace design must include dynamic flexibility to
support new capabilities

Adaptive Airspace Applications Today
 Sector combining/de-combining
 Based on traffic volume (i.e., mid-night configuration)

 Reallocation of TRACON when airport is closed
 Akron-Canton Regional Airport

 Reallocation of Fix Posting Area (FPA)
 Due to sector traffic volume : ZNY DGRAF (next slide)
 Due to airport runway configuration : ZMA FPA4614

 Special Use Airspace assignment
 Buckeye MOA in ZID

 Proposed an FPA around middle
track that can be allocated to either

 Analysis of traffic count shows that
dynamic allocation of FPA reduces
imbalance in sector traffic count
 Other considerations must include:
 Point-outs (MDW and
Milwaukee departures)
 Traffic mix in sector
(Jets/props)

Limitations and Potential Mitigations in
Adaptive Airspace Design (1/2)
 Why is adaptive airspace not happening today? And
what will enable adaptive airspace?
 Technology Limitations
 Automation support for configuration change  ERAM
(En Route Automation Modernization)
 Handoff access to non-contiguous sectors - ERAM
 Access to flight plan data  ERAM, 4D-trajectory
 Access to map data  ERAM
 Sort box overlap  ADS-B (Automatic Dependent
Surveillance  Broadcast)
 Automated information transfer and other data block
issues  ERAM

Limitations and Potential Mitigations in
Adaptive Airspace Design (2/2)
 Display hardware - ERAM
 Voice communications  Voice Over Internet Protocol
 Data communications architecture  FAA-wide Internet
Protocol

 Human factors
 Resistance to change
 Training, qualification and maintaining currency in
flexible airspace
 Time/workload to change airspace configuration

Summary
 Adaptive airspace redesign for flexible and
efficient use of available airspace
 Samples presented :
 Dynamic FPA allocation based on sector traffic
volume/complexity (ZNY and ZAU)
 Dynamic reconfiguration of sector during special
activity (Utah Spaceport)

 Todays automation system poses
implementation challenges until new
technologies (ERAM, ADS-B, 4D-traj) become
widely available
