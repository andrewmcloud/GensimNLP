Problem
 Infrastructureless (Ad Hoc) Wireless Networks
 Currently very unreliable and inefficient
 Critical to Network Centric Warfare
 Critical in both mobile and sensor networks

 Trend in commercial wireless: smart nodes with
sophisticated signal processing on soft information at the
physical layer (802.11n, UMTS, LTE, 802.16)
[picture taken from TAT briefing 2006]
 Increased capacity, decreased latency
 We are addressing problems in wireless communication that are critical to the defense
and intelligence sector

 Ad hoc networks: Grand Challenge of Communications and Networking


Create simple networks of smart nodes=> Improve throughput and reliability

 Satellite Communications  Rateless codes eliminates margin requirements, allow
a tremendous increase in data rate, and can keep links alive during outages
 LPI/LPD Communications  Rateless codes enable optimal use of scarce resources

OPPORTUNISTIC COMMUNICATIONS: Allows automatic
adaptation of the data rate in response to changing channel
conditions while maintaining rate near theoretical capacity

Activities
 Rateless Coding Concepts
 Development and simulation of a practical binary rateless coding scheme that
comes within 1 dB of capacity for all rates below  and all SNRs below 1 dB
that is suitable for incorporation into LPI/LPD waveforms
 Simulation of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation using rateless base code and
hybrid ARQ based on LTE system
 Development of a non-patent infringing fountain-accumulate code that
outperforms raptor codes and is immune to random punctures

 Cooperative Diversity
 Contributions to emerging 802.16 that facilitate using smart relays as ad hoc
network elements
 Fountain-accumulate code is ideal for use with cooperative diversity

Highlight: Fountain Accumulate Codes
Patent Pending

 Fountain Codes  Can decode with any arbitrary collection of bits. Useful for
point-to-point rateless coding, cooperative communications and multicast
applications. Potentially good for parallel channel. e.g. Raptor codes

 Fountain Accumulate Codes  new codes invented under MSR
k input bits

parity checks

accumulator

Main Difference
with Raptor codes

n output bits

 Can be optimized for the erasure channel (capacity approaching) and
the AWGN channel ( < 1dB from capacity)  outperform Raptor

 Low complexity: O(N) decoding; moderate number of iterations (~15);
no need for outer code; Raptor code is more complex

 Suitable for high-order modulations

Demonstration
 GNU Radio runs on both SONY PS3 with Cell Broadband Engine
 USRP provide RF link between both PS3s

PS3 Cell Engine

 Established a TCP/IP link for communication
 TX PS3 encodes data with 1/6 rate Turbo code
 Encoding executes on PPE (PowerPC)

PowerPC

E
SP
E

 Transmits the whole 1/6 rate data

 RX PS3 decodes in a rateless fashion
 Attempt to decode at decreasing rates (2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6)
 Basic steps:
 Puncture received data for rate R
 Call decoder on punctured data
 Check CRC

- If FAILED, then repeat with next rate
- If PASSED, then done

 Decoder executes on the SPE (Synchronous Processing Element)
