Rapid sequence homology assessment by
subsampling the genome space using difference sets
Andrzej K. Brodzik

Abstract Availability of DNA data is growing roughly at the
rate specified by Moores law. In many molecular biology applications this data needs to be compared with a reference sequence,
either to establish similarity of genomes, or to identify functionally homologous subsequences. Current approaches based on
pair-wise sequence alignments are computationally expensive and
often data dependent. To ameliorate this problem, alternative,
reduced complexity sequence comparison schemes, designed to
capture the essential features of genomes need to be explored. In
this work a new sequence comparison approach, based on difference sets models, is proposed. These models are conceptually
appropriate, as they quantify, in a certain sense, the degree of
both sequence complexity and symbol repetition. Moreover, it is
shown that difference sets are abundant in bacterial genomes
and that they coincide with homologous sequence segments.
Subsequently, compact representations of DNA sequences are
constructed in the difference set space, and an alignment of these
representations is obtained. This procedure permits identification
of homologous DNA sequences and determination of fine genomic
differences between these sequences in a small fraction of the
time required by current methods. As an illustration of efficacy
of the difference set approach, characterization of indels in
closely related bacillus anthracis strains is performed, resulting
in the discovery of two previously unreported collections of
polymorphisms. In conclusion, an extension of the difference set
approach to almost difference set families is outlined, availing
a new mathematical framework for sequence complexity studies
and phylogenetic analyses.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In order to try to understand genome organization, we must
explore the distribution of genes along the chromosome.
However, to do this effectively, we should generalize the
concept of a neighborhood to many more types of vicinities
than the mere succession of genes in the genomic text.
Antoine Danchin
In a recent book, Delphic boat, one of the pioneers of microbial genomics, Antoine Danchin, deliberates on the role mathematics and information theory might play in future molecular
biology research [16]. At the outset of the investigation, he
recalls an ancient question (originally posed to an oracle in
Delphi) whether a boat whose planks have all been replaced
over time is still the same boat. Is it therefore - he asks - the
individual components (genes, codons, nucleotides, etc), or the

totality of relationships between them that defines the whole
(genome)? The question seems to be of both fundamental and
timely importance, as we embark on the journey of deciphering
the genomic code. Should we attempt to deduce biological
function and organism phylogeny simply by comparing individual parts, or rather, should we set a more ambitious
goal, and try to guess the overall blueprint for the genomic
construction? Danchin suggests that the latter endeavor might
be more fruitful. If so, we should then investigate, without
undue prejudices, what are the constituent components of
genomes and how do they fit together into the whole. One of
the first steps towards accomplishing this goal is to identify the
atomic components of the genomic sequence and to investigate
correlation of their distribution with a biological function.
In this work we begin this journey by identifying the
genomic atoms with short random strings, associated with
algebraic constructs known as cyclic difference sets, and by
exploring the utility of these strings in a key molecular
biology task, DNA sequence homology evaluation. By homology evaluation we mean sequence comparison performed
by matching subsampled versions of the original sequences.
Such evaluation is of both theoretical and practical interest,
as it permits, at a reduced computational cost, (1) identifying,
from a large pool of data, those sequences that are in some
way close to the query sequence, and (2) performing a
rough sequence alignment that provides an indication of the
overall sequence similarity. For arbitrary sequences, in the
implementation described in this work, this alignment will
not necessarily account for all individual nucleotide insertions
and deletions, or indels, but it will account for regions of
significant sequence variation, such as insertion and deletion
segments. However, for highly homologous sequences, such as
human or bacterial strain DNA, this alignment will produce a
list of all or nearly all genomic differences. This approach is
appropriate for general large-scale sequence comparison tasks,
such as matching a query sequence against a sequence library
(e.g., NCBI GenBank, currently holding data in excess of

in sequence length), or for more specialized searches
(e.g., rapid bacterial strain identification), where the goal is to
identify a small collection of highly homologous sequences
and to generate a list of all genomic variations between
sequences in that collection. As an illustration of efficacy
of the difference set approach, characterization of indels in
two closely related bacillus anthracis strains is performed,
resulting in the discovery of previously unreported collections
of polymorphisms.
Alignment-free sequence homology evaluation was considered previously in many works, including [4], [10], [15], [21],

[23], [33], and [47]. A useful review of earlier research in this
area is given in [53]. Homology evaluation techniques can
be divided into two main categories: (1) methods based on
word frequency and (2) methods that do not involve counting
segments of fixed length. Methods in the first category utilize
statistics of word frequency to identify homologous regions
in sequences and frequency vectors to compute a distance
between these sequences. Methods in the second category
are more diverse. They seek sequence representations that
are scale independent and utilize distance measures rooted in
Shannon information theory, Kolmogorov complexity theory,
or chaos theory. Regardless of the approach, most of these
methods focus, in contrast to this work, on protein sequence
similarity.
The approach described here formally belongs to the first
category. It is distinct, however, in several important respects
delineated below. The proposed procedure consists of two,
essentially algebraic computations: the construction of sequences of homology markers and the alignment of these
sequences by a fast implementation of the cross-correlation
method. The replacement of the analysis of DNA sequences
with an analysis of homology marker sequences results in a
significant reduction of the number of computations required.
This number is proportional to the ratio of lengths of these
sequences. The choice of homology markers is motivated
by recent developments in the DNA sequence complexity
assessment, inspired by ideas borrowed from combinatorics
[8]. The point of departure in this assessment is a proposition
that specifies a complex sequence as a sequence that contains
no repetitions [13], [54]. In combinatorics such a sequence is
associated with the concept of a difference set [31], [52]. As
sequences derived from difference sets are repetition-free, the
study of DNA sequence complexity can then be cast as a study
of difference sets. This approach has several advantages:
 The concept of complexity becomes closely coupled with
many biologically relevant phenomena that coincide with
the occurrence of repetitive DNA symbols [7], [46],
 The use of difference sets enables algebraic analysis,
which is advantageous in many applications, as statistics
of DNA sequences vary significantly and reliable estimates are difficult to obtain [26],
 In contrast with several standard approaches [32], [30],
difference set based complexity measure is easily computable.
These advantages are most readily realized in the design of
a sequence complexity assessment scheme. However, since
one of the goals of the DNA sequence complexity analysis
is the assessment of information distance between genomes,
it follows that difference sets which this analysis relies on
are also appropriate candidates for DNA sequence homology
markers.
The concept of difference sets is in certain respects similar
to the idea of spaced seeds that was recently proposed to improve efficacy of sequence alignment algorithms [9], [37]. The
advantage of spaced seeds comes about because hits to spaced
seeds are more independent than hits to non-spaced seeds [55].
While spaced seeds often incorporate probabilistic a priori
information such as open reading frame constraints, thereby

tailoring the design to the application at hand, difference sets
are general algebraic constructs, defined by their correlation
properties. This is beneficial as, apart from a convenient association with the atoms of randomness, difference sets are more
likely to be free from recent, repetition-based mutations and
from sequencing errors which occur more often in repetitive
sequence regions. Difference sets might also have a slight
advantage over arbitrary strings in terms of abundance: in
arbitrary sequences short non-repetitive patterns tend to occur
more often than those that include repetitions [17].
Apart from distinct constructions, there is also a difference
in how spaced seeds and difference sets are embedded in their
respective applications. While, like with spaced seeds, we use
difference sets to identify regions of sequence similarity, we
depart from the usual sequence alignment approach in that
we do not attempt to grow difference sets to larger matching
sequences, but instead use the distribution of difference sets in
DNA sequences directly to evaluate DNA sequence homology.
This approach reduces dimensionality of the problem significantly. We show that for certain bacterial sequences the ratio
of DNA and difference set sequence lengths is of the order of a
few hundreds. Similar data reduction is expected for genomes
of other organisms.
The second component of the homology evaluation procedure involves a fast realization of the cross-correlation
based sequence alignment algorithm. This realization is based
on sequence matching in the Fourier space. Multiplicative
complexity of this approach is of the order of  , which
is much better than the multiplicative complexity afforded by
most standard methods. This approach is not entirely new.
Fourier space cross-correlation has been explored previously
in several works, including [25] and [49]. Here, we propose the
use of a variation on this theme, described in [6], that relies
on matching Fourier space sequences by their phases only.
This variation has the advantage that certain spurious sequence
matches due to repetitive components of the DNA sequence
are avoided, and therefore unambiguous determination of
matching sequence segments can be made.
The content of the paper is as follows. Section II introduces
the concept of difference sets. Section III reviews the phaseonly approach to cross-correlation. Section IV explores the
abundance of difference sets in bacterial genomes. Section V
describes the two main results of the paper: the difference
set based sequence homology assessment algorithm and the
characterization of indels in two bacillus anthracis strains.
Section VI compares computational efficiency of the algorithm
with benchmarks. Section VII discusses extensions of the
difference set model to almost difference set families. Section
VIII summarizes results and outlines directions for further
research.
II. T HE DIFFERENCE SET MODEL
In this section we define difference sets and show how they
can be used to model pseudo-random DNA strings.
A. DNA symbol representation

letters  ,  ,  , and  , that represent the four nucleotides

of the genetic code: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
Prior to processing the DNA sequence, the symbolic characters
have to be assigned numerical values. The simplest method of
numerically representing the DNA sequence is to split it into
four subsequences associated with the four nucleotides, and


to denote by   and   the occurrence and absence of each
letter in the relevant subsequence1. For example, the symbolic
sequence

    
can be represented by the four binary subsequences
   
     
    
     

 
 
 
 

Given this representation, each binary subsequence can then

results permits verifying equivalence of difference sets. Two

set corresponds to the sequence

sequence has a two-valued autocorrelation observe that the

B. Cyclic difference sets

    

While difference set theory is considered an integral part of
combinatorial design theory, the field incorporates methods
from many branches of mathematics. One of the first mentions
of difference sets was in connection with a certain problem
in additive number theory [20], [50]. The systematic study
of difference sets started with the paper by a group theorist,
Marshall Hall [22], who introduced the concept of multipliers.
Subsequent developments disclosed relation of difference sets
to finite geometry techniques. Today, due to their association
with sequences with ideal correlation properties, difference
sets are used in several applications, including communications, radar, navigation, cryptography, coding theory, and
statistical design. The seminal works on this subject are [5]
and [31]; a useful tutorial is a chapter by Jungnickel and Pott
in [43]; up to date results are summarized in [12].
It is convenient to define difference sets using the language
of group theory. Suppose  is the additive group of  integers
modulo  and  is a  -subset of  . The set  is a 
cyclic difference set of  if in the set of all differences of
distinct elements in  ,

      

     
  
every nonzero element of  occurs exactly  number of times.

Although formally cyclic difference sets are a subcategory of
a larger family of combinatorial designs known as difference
sets, for brevity in this work we will refer to cyclic difference
sets simply as difference sets.
The main unresolved problem in the study of difference sets
pertains to their existence. There are many rules that guide
construction of difference sets. For example, difference sets
satisfy the well-known necessary condition

             

1 Alternative DNA symbol representations, using complex and hypercomplex number systems, convenient in certain tasks, are given, among others, in
[2] and [7].

    
     
     
    

The perfect autocorrelation property of sequences associated
with difference sets suggests that difference sets can be used
in DNA sequence complexity studies. Sequence complexity is
intrinsically coupled with the lack of local regularities, or alternatively, with the concept of randomness. Since a sequence
associated with a difference set displays no repetitions, such
sequence can be referred to as algebraically random. In effect,
information content of a DNA sequence can be assessed in
terms of its relation to a difference set. The simplest way of
performing this assessment is a direct comparison.
Given the DNA symbol representation of previous subsection, the association of DNA subsequences with difference sets
is straightforward. Take, for example, the sequence

          
This sequence can be represented by the four subsequences
          
          
          
           

 
 
 
 

It follows from inspection that the first subsequence is asso

ciated with the difference set   , the second and third
ones are semi-periodic, and the forth one is of neither type 2 .
2 It will be shown in Section VII that sequences of this type can be modeled
by combinatorial generalizations of difference sets.

III. P HASE - ONLY F OURIER

SPACE CROSS - CORRELATION

One of the most efficient algorithms for DNA sequence
alignment is the cross-correlation method. The main computations of the procedure are the discrete Fourier transform
and a pointwise multiplication of two complex Fourier transform sequences. The overall computational complexity of the
algorithm is    , which is significantly lower then 
afforded by methods based on dynamic programming [34],
[39], [51] and suffix trees [19], [29]. The popular BLASTn
and MegaBLAST algorithms (of the BLAST family) are
reputed to be faster; however, complexity of these methods is
difficult to evaluate since the number of computations required
depends on many parameters, including the length of the seed
sequence, the drop-off value for seed extension, treatment
of gaps, sequence similarity, etc. ([37], [28]). Computational
complexity of the cross-correlation approach, on the other
hand, is easily quantifiable, it does not depend on the data,
and it does not have inherent limitations on the sequence size.
This approach is the basis of several existing algorithms of
which the best known is perhaps MAFFT ([25]).
In [6] a comparison was made between the standard
magnitude-and-phase cross-correlation and the lesser known,
but closely related, phase-only cross-correlation A brief description of this approach is given below.
Define the cyclic cross-correlation, or the MF (matched
filter), of two real discrete sequences  and  by

Fourier transforms of   and  , respectively.

the cross-correlation can be efficiently implemented by computing

               

An alternative measure of sequence similarity is given by
the SPOMF (symmetric phase-only matched filter), defined by

then there might be several values of  for which    is

greater than a pre-defined threshold. These values are called
the dominant values of the phase-only cross-correlation. They
correspond to cyclic shifts of  that produce alignments of
segments of  and  . Increasing slightly the generality of
the problem, one might choose  to be a query sequence
and  a concatenation of all sequences in a database. In this
case the analysis proceeds as before, with the difference that
the dominant values of the cross-correlation point now to the
most homologous sequences (with the query sequence) in the
database. Since  and  are of disproportional lengths, it is

often convenient to implement this computation by repeatedly
correlating  with appropriately chosen segments of  .
SPOMF had been proposed two decades ago in optical
signal processing [24], and heuristic arguments have been
made that the method is superior to the standard approach
in terms of misalignment resolution and robustness to noise.
Since then it has been successfully applied to image registration, watermarking, and sonar, among others. In [6] it
was shown that when applied to DNA sequences SPOMF
produces a higher accuracy sequence alignment by reducing
the effect of spurious sequence segment matches that arise due
to occurrence of symbol repetitions.
IV. D IFFERENCE SETS

IN BACTERIAL GENOMES

In this section we investigate utility of the difference set
model in DNA sequence analysis. In particular, we compare
distributions of difference sets in several DNA sequences of
varying degree of homology. By a distribution of difference
sets we mean an indicator sequence of length equal to the
length of the DNA sequence under consideration, where one
marks the occurrence of a difference set in the DNA sequence
and zero the lack of thereof. As part of this characterization,
we will evaluate the relative abundance of difference sets in
DNA sequences. This abundance informs both how similar
these sequences are to an algebraically random reference
sequence and the feasibility of construction of parsimonious
representations of these sequences in the difference set space.
We focus the investigation on the bacillus anthracis
genome. The reason for this choice is the fact that bacillus
anthracis strains are highly monomorphic, which makes differentiation of these sequences an especially difficult problem
[27], [35], [36], [42], and the genome a good test case for
efficacy of the proposed approach. In general, the bacillus
anthracis genome is made up of chromosomal DNA and two
plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2. The occurrence of the conserved
plasmid sequences in the genome is particularly important,
as it often coincides with the strain toxicity. However, not all
strains contain both plasmids. Even when they do, the plasmid
sequences need not be identical. Plasmids can be exchanged
between distinct bacillus anthracis strains, undergoing in the
process sequence alterations, including mutations, deletions
and horizontal gene transfer. In effect, identification of these
genomic differences is essential for determination of the
bacillus anthracis genome recent evolutionary changes and for
evaluation of the bacillus anthracis strain pathogenic potency.
In the first experiment
   we evaluated the abundance of
the difference set   3 in two sequences of the bacillus
anthracis pXO2 plasmid, associated with the strains Ames
Ancestor
and Pasteur (AF188935). The difference
  (AE017335)

set   was chosen because it is the shortest difference
set and therefore it is likely to sample the DNA sequence
at a higher density than other difference sets.
  We found that
the Ames Ancestor plasmid contains 1672   difference
3 As described in section 2, a sequence contains a string associated with
the difference set  if and only if any of the four binary subsequences
contains a string  . For example, the sequence  contains
 , while the sequence  does not.

sets (569 in  , 294 in  , 171 in  , and 638 difference sets
in
and the Pasteur plasmid contains 1691
    subsequence),
 difference sets (573 in  , 296 in  , 175 in  , and
649 difference sets in  subsequences). The difference sets
are dispersed fairly uniformly throughout the plasmids and the
distribution of the difference sets in both sequences follows a
similar pattern (Figure 1).
Excluding certain relatively short (less than 500 bp (base
pairs)) flanking sequences, the central portions of the Ames
Ancestor and Pasteur plasmid sequences constitute segments
of length 94,728 and 94,705 bp, respectively. These segments
can be identified by matching the difference sets that are
are located at the extremes of plasmids and are identical
in both sequences. The segments vary at 75 places. The
genomic differences include VNTRs (variable number tan
dem repeats) (about   ), putative SNPs (single nucleotide

polymorphisms) (about   ) and non-repeat related indels

(insertions/deletions) (about  ). VNTRs are a small fraction
of all significant (longer than 6 symbols) exact tandem repeats.
The total number of tandem repeats in plasmids is 2178. This
number is somewhat smaller than the number of difference
sets, when both orientations of difference sets are accounted
for (which then doubles the total number of difference sets).
Considering the length of the difference set string, the abun 
dance of difference sets in the plasmid sequence is about  ,
which is similar to the abundance of SNPs and indels.

distributions are distinct.

HOMOLOGY ASSESSMENT

In this section we describe the algorithm for difference set
based sequence homology assessment and characterize indels
in the bacillus anthracis genome.
A. Sequence homology assessment algorithm
Abundance and similarity of distributions of difference sets in
bacillus anthracis plasmids suggests that difference sets are
appropriate candidates for DNA sequence homology markers.
Since distributions of difference sets are significantly shorter
than DNA sequences, similarity of the distributions can be
assessed faster than similarity of the DNA sequences. The
speed advantage of this procedure is additionally enhanced,
when coupled with the Fourier space cross-correlation method.

The main step in the design of the difference set based DNA
sequence homology assessment procedure is the construction
of a compact representation of the difference set distribution.
This step can be implemented in several ways. In the following
we describe the simplest (but not necessarily the most efficient)
of these implementations. Alternative approaches, including
the approach relying on difference set distribution analysis in
the wavelet domain, will be explored in further research.

Denote by  and
the DNA sequences to be assessed,
by  and  the difference set distributions and by  and
 the corresponding compactified difference set sequences
associated with a selected nucleotide. Denote by  and 
the lengths of the DNA and the compactified difference set
sequences, respectively, and by  the order of the additive
group of integers,  , that determine the length of the
difference
set. The assessment of homology between  and

can then be accomplished by the following two-stage
procedure.
Algorithm
In the first stage of the algorithm, difference sets distributions
are used to evaluate rough sequence homology in a barcode
matching fashion. Individual tasks are as follows:
 Compute difference set distributions of the DNA se
quences under consideration,  and ,

 


  
  
  
   

 
and

     

   
 

  
     
 
  
This task requires   real additions per sequence.
Convert  -point difference set distribution sequences,
 and  , to shorter,  -point sequences of locations
of difference sets (i.e., the difference set sequences), 
and  .









 







Compute the phase-only cross-correlation of the difference set sequences,

 
     
  
                 
where  and  denote the DFTs
 of  and  , respectively.

This task requires         complex multiplications.
Use the dominant values of the cross-correlation sequence
(as explained in section 3) to identify homologous and
non-homologous blocks of the original DNA sequences.
For example, suppose that the dominant value of the
cross-correlation sequence occurs at  . Then a homologous segment is given by the non-zero values of the
vector

 
                                        

This task requires   real multiplications, where  is the
number
of the cross-correlation sequence dominant values
  when
(
sequences are identical).

In the second stage of the algorithm, non-homologous blocks
whose boundaries coincide with appropriate difference sets
are individually aligned to reveal fine differences between
genomes.
B. Characterization of indels in bacillus anthracis pXO1
plasmid and chromosomal sequences
To evaluate efficacy of the difference set homology assessment approach, we first compared the two pXO1 plasmids

and
  . As in previous experiment, the      difference set was chosen for the analysis. Results of individual
computations of the first stage of the algorithm are shown in
Figure 4 (step 1), Figure 5 (steps 2 and 3) and Figure 6 (step
4)5 .
The first step of the algorithm requires the
 computation
of the difference set distributions,   and  . These distributions are shown in Figure 4: the sequence of the Ames
Ancestor plasmid (upper plot) and the sequence of the Sterne
plasmid (lower plot). The distributions are obtained by a
running window analysis of the binary sequence associated
with the nucleotide  , as described in step 1 of the algorithm.
Visual inspection of the two plots reveals a high degree of
sequence similarity. However, except for an obvious mismatch
in the barcode pattern in the latter part of the sequence
(approximately, between 120,000 and 160,000 bp), clustering
of difference set index marks obstructs determination of the
exact boundaries of the matching segments.
In the second step of the algorithm the  -point distributions
of difference sets are converted to shorter,  -point sequences
 and  of inter-difference set gap lengths. These sequences
are shown in the two top plots of Figure 5. This step is
followed by a conversion of the base-ten integer numbers to
binary numbers and computation of the Fourier space phaseonly cross-correlation between the two binary sequences. The
latter computation is the most costly part of the algorithm,
with multiplicative complexity of the order of  (step
3). The result of this computation is shown in the bottom plot
of Figure 5.
The plot reveals three significant (i.e., greater than 0.25)
peaks at locations 0, 2, and 36. These peaks reveal the presence
of three matching (   ,   and  ) and two mismatching
(   and   ) segments in the difference set sequences. These
segments can be identified by comparing the first difference
set sequence with appropriately shifted second difference set
sequence (step 4). Result of this operation is shown in Figure
6. A rough pictorial representation of segment decomposition
of the two sequences is given by the graph

lengths rather than difference set locations, only a rough visual comparison
between the plots in Figures 4 and 5 can be made.

In subsequent analysis, for brevity, we will ignore the superscripts, when the identity of the sequence in question will be

of
difference sets (indices

corresponds
to the mismatching segment   located between
        

    bp in the Ames Ancestor DNA sequence.
This
segment contains the insertion segment   -319 located at
         

   bp (see Table 1 for details).
While the first stage of the algorithm permits rough alignment of the plasmid sequences, including the determination of
matching segments and large insertion segments, the second
stage permits the determination of fine structure of indels.
This is accomplished by identification of zeroes in the two
difference set sequences. The occurrence of zeroes (within
matching segments) is a consequence of differences in lengths
of associated sections of DNA sequences, which, in turn, are
due to the occurrence of indels. There are five such zeroes in
segment   , five in segment   , and two in segment   (see
Table 1). For example, the first zero occurs at the beginning of
segment   (index 3). Mapping the difference set zero index to
DNA sequence coordinates
the 607 bp Ames Ancestor
     reveals

and
the 472 bp Sterne section


   
located at 
  bp. The difference in section lengths is
due to the 135 bp long insertion sequence   -3 located at
 
     bp (in Ames Ancestor coordinates).
Alignment of DNA sections corresponding to all relevant
difference set pairs reveals three relatively large insertion
sequences of lengths 135, 85 and 21 bps, and nine single base
indels. The three large insertion sequences (   -3,   -77 and
 -336) have been reported previously [45] (referred to therein
as IX1-2, IX1-1 and VX1-3, respectively); the discovery of the
nine single base indels   -20,   -90,   -103,   -194,   -203,
  -205,   -218,   -247, and   -321 is a new result.
6 Note,

that the length of a segment of difference set distribution is
determined by the number of difference sets it contains, not by the number
of bps.
7 The structure of the large insertion segment
-139 can be further refined:
allowing for the occurrence of additional 3 indels and 21 SNPs in the matching
segments
and
places the insertion segment at the increased resolution
positions of 43348-48589 bp (Ames Ancestor coordinates) and 43297-48539
bp (Sterne coordinates).

used, where only position of the relevant difference set is identified; the four 4431 indels that occur within the same difference
set segment are distinguished

by the number in the suffix. The indel -4431-3 consists of 10 bp insertion
string in the Ames Ancestor chromosome and 8 bp insertion string in the
Ames chromosome.

To test the efficacy of the difference set approach on

It follows that the plasmid sequences are about

While in both cases sequences contain multiple indels (14

difference is concentrated in two large insertion segments

VI. C OMPARISON



WITH BENCHMARKS

In previous section we described a novel algorithm for efficient identification of matching and mismatching regions of
highly homologous DNA sequences. Here, we compare performance of this algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods.
Surprisingly, few techniques have been designed to directly
address the aforementioned problem. The homology methods
mentioned earlier ([10], [23], [33]) deal only with the protein
sequences. DNA sequence alignment methods, on the other
hand, such as BLAST, MuMmer and PatternHunter, are not
well suited to this task: they produce large lists of difficult to
disambiguate overlapping alignments, rather than enumeration
of unique genomic differences. The only generally available
method we were able to identify that targets the same application as the difference set approach is the diffseq code of the
EMBOSS suit of sequence analysis tools [48].
We compared the performance of diffseq and difference
sets methods using the pXO1 plasmids (181,654 bp) and
the chromosomal sequences (5,227,293 bp) of two strains of
the bacillus anthracis genome. Experiments were performed
on 2.13 GHz Pentium PC with 1GB of memory, running
Microsoft Windows XP. Diffseq was run as part of the latest
version of EMBOSS suit, downloaded from the EMBI website
on March 15, 2009. The difference set algorithm was run
in MATLAB 7.0.1 (R14). Diffseq produced identical lists
of indels as the difference set approach. However, diffseq
required 5 seconds to process the plasmid sequences and it ran
out of memory while processing the chromosomal sequences.
In contrast, the proposed algorithm required 0.09 seconds to
process the plasmid sequences and 1.83 seconds to process the

chromosomal sequences. Apart from differences in processing
speed, these results suggest that the memory space required by
diffseq, while difficult to estimate due to the hash table method
used, is significantly larger than that of the difference set
approach. In current, prototype implementation the difference
set algorithm requires storing both DNA sequences; this space
requirement can be easily reduced by a factor of about 500, as
the core computation is performed on much shorter difference
set sequences.
Although, as we remarked before, sequence alignment
methods target a distinct set of applications, since the difference set based homology assessment is closely coupled with
the phase-only Fourier space sequence alignment technique
(referred to in [6] as the symmetric phase-only matched filter,
or SPOMF), it is appropriate to consider the relative merits
of the difference set approach, SPOMF and the most popular
sequence alignment tool, BLAST. A detailed comparison of
SPOMF and BLAST (the fast MegaBLAST version) was given
in [6]. Here, we give only a brief summary.
SPOMF consistently outperforms BLAST
in alignment run 
bp, which is far
time for sequence sizes greater then
less than the size of any reasonable sequence database (NCBI
   
GenBank total sequence size exceeds
bp). Apart from
delivering higher computational efficiency, SPOMF overcomes
BLAST several other deficiencies, including data dependent
run-time, lack of a multi-scale processing stage, and a high
degree of parameterization that is not readily transparent to
the user.
While the difference set approach relies on SPOMF for
speeding up the computation of its main stage, it achieves a
significant run-time reduction over the direct implementation
of SPOMF by sub-sampling the DNA sequence space. In
contrast to BLAST, which due to the heuristic nature of its core
computations does not avail analytical complexity assessment,
the computational advantage of difference sets over SPOMF
can be easily quantified.

algorithm is

interest to consider the distributions of both components in
the DNA sequence.
Short random and repetitive strings, which we call pure
strings, account for about half of the bacillus anthracis
genome. The remaining half is made up of strings that have
mixed properties and a relatively small number of longer
random and repetitive strings. A short representative fragment
of the joint distribution of pure strings is shown in Figure 7. As
expected, the two types of pure strings do not overlap, although
they may occur in close proximity. Over large scales (shown in
the upper plot), pure strings sample the DNA sequence space
fairly uniformly. Over shorter scales (shown in the lower plot)
the sampling appears more haphazard: consecutive pure strings
might be separated by 100 or more nucleotides. This result
suggests further inquiries.
First, does the local non-uniformity of string distribution encode significant information? Recent investigations of keyword
statistics in natural languages and energy levels in nuclear
physics indicate that this indeed might be the case [11], [41],
[40], [38]. If this conjecture is confirmed for difference sets,
the difference set techniques could be used, among others, for
certain de novo computational biology tasks, such as identification of core genomes and their constituent components. This
issue is of separate interest and will be addressed elsewhere.
Second, while subsampled representations of DNA sequences obtained by difference set analysis are appropriate
for homology studies of closely related genomes, some applications, such as DNA sequence compression, phylogenetic
tree reconstruction and comparison of more distant sequences,
may require sequence interrogation at very fine scales. In
these cases, the construction of a representation of the entire
DNA sequence, including segments made up of mixed and
longer strings, is needed. This task requires the use of more
complex tools, including difference set and almost difference
set families. The remainder of this section explores some of
the issues involved in the design of these tools.

DIFFERENCE SETS

The results of the bacillus anthracis genome analysis suggest
that difference set representations capture essential features of
DNA sequences. However, while difference sets are appropriate models for random sequences, both random and repetitive
strings occur in genomes. As random and repetitive strings
are combinatorial opposites, it is of information-theoretical

subsequences, associated with the symbols  ,  ,  , and  .
However, it is of at least an equal interest to evaluate the
DNA sequence as a whole. To do so, one needs to consider
the concept of a difference set family.

To obtain a construction that is in some way close to a

to relax the definition of the difference set or the definition of
the perfect block disjoint difference set family. The next two
subsections illustrate the two cases.

While the count of individual nucleotide bases in bacterial
genomes often varies considerably, a convenient simplified
model for the DNA sequence is one that assumes an equal
frequency of occurrence of the four DNA symbols. Such
model requires a decomposition of the DNA sequence into four
non-overlapping difference sets,   . Unfortunately,
  as
we have shown in Subsection A, difference sets with 
do not exist. Alternatively, one can relax the difference set
condition and only require that the autocorrelation sidelobe is

not greater than some

this relaxed condition is called an almost difference set [3],
[44]. Formally,

Relating the above result to DNA sequences, it can be
said that no non-trivial DNA sequence having an equal
abundance of the four nucleotides is algebraically random.
While this statement might seem non-constructive, the degree
of randomness of a DNA sequence can be quantified. For
example, by allowing  to take values greater  than zero,
for each  for which an almost difference set   
exists one can specify a sequence that produces the lowest
autocorrelation sidelobes possible. Suppose that, at some fixed

VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
A new approach for the analysis of DNA sequences, based
on combinatorial-analytic concepts, was proposed. In this
approach the DNA sequence is represented by its subsampled
version derived from the distribution of difference sets. This
representation is convenient, as (1) difference sets capture the
random character of the DNA sequence and hence sequence
homology markers can be directly linked with sequence regions of high combinatorial complexity and, possibly, with
regions that have longer evolutionary history, and (2) the
analysis of DNA sequences can be replaced by the analysis
of much shorter difference set sequences thereby reducing
the cost of computation. Direct applications of the difference
set approach are rapid sequence homology assessment and
one-against-all database match search. To test efficacy of the
difference set approach in these applications experiments on
closely related strains of the bacillus anthracis genome were
performed. Results of these experiments include:









Characterization of abundance of the   difference
set in the bacillus anthracis genome.
Demonstration that the computational efficiency of the
proposed approach exceeds the efficiency of the state-ofthe-art methods, diffseq and BLAST,
Discovery of collections of novel indels in bacillus anthracis plasmid and chromosomal sequences, and

The first result shows that, apart from comparative in silico
studies, difference sets can be used as increased resolution
strain markers for an experimental assay based bacterial sequence ID. Current genotyping approaches in this category are
limited, for the most part, to parsimonious assays that rely on
a relatively small number of non-uniformly distributed VNTRs
or SNPs [35]. These assays can identify individual strains
from a limited collection of fully sequenced, closely related
genomes. However, they are not effective when only partial
sequence data is available, the data contains sequencing errors,
or the collection includes unknown strains. In these cases it is
required that the bacterial genome space is sampled at multiple
loci and with a greater degree of uniformity. As difference sets
occur in bacterial genomes more frequently than either VNTRs
or SNPs, a difference set based strain fingerprinting scheme
can address these issues more effectively.
Sequence homology assessment can be viewed as an application of sequence complexity studies. These studies often link
the concept of complexity with the concept of randomness.
Addressing this broader application domain, the investigation
described in this paper has shown that no significant part of the
DNA sequence can be considered algebraically random. Future
research utilizing more advanced difference set constructions,
such as almost difference set families, may permit further
quantification of this result in terms of degrees of randomness. If successful, this investigation may lead towards the
design of new approaches for DNA sequence compression and
phylogenetic tree reconstruction. A preliminary mathematical

formalism for decomposing DNA sequence into almost difference sets, which will assist investigation of such approaches,
has been outlined in Section VII.
Several areas require further research. First, we have demonstrated efficacy of the difference set approach on homologous
sequences. This analysis can be broaden to more distantly
related and non-homologous sequences. Second, the formalism
described in Section VII focused on individual difference
sets and on canonical difference set families comprised of
difference sets of equal lengths. This formalism can be extended to collections of almost difference set families with
mixed parameters that include difference sets spanning a range
of values of  and  , and permit quantification of various
dependencies
difference sets, such as the subsumption
  among


of   by   . Third, while the proposed homology
assessment algorithm is highly efficient, an exploration of
multi-grain sequence processing approaches, including the
analysis in multi-scale spaces, might bring about additional
performance gains. Such analysis will produce progressively
higher resolution alignments of subsampled sequences by
performing Fourier analysis on wavelet representations. This
approach might prove particularly valuable when applied to
less homologous sequences and to future petascale databases.

Andrzej K. Brodzik received MS degree from Gdansk Polytechnic
and PhD degree from City University of New York, both in electrical
engineering. He has held positions with IBM, Tufts University, Air
Force Research Laboratory, and MITRE. He published on a wide
range of topics, including mathematical biology, radar and communications sequence design, data fusion, hyperspectral image processing,
and time-frequency analysis. His main interest is in the design of
discrete sequences with special mathematical properties for molecular biology and radar/communications systems applications. Among
others, these properties facilitate specification of sparsity conditions
for signal representations in high-dimensional spaces, identification of
faithful mappings of symbolic alphabets to algebraic number systems,
and construction of effective signal subsampling schemes. The goal
in all of these cases is to capture, in a succinct manner, the gestalt
of the underlying biological or physical phenomenon. Dr. Brodzik
is currently leading MITRE effort on pathogenic sequence forensics,
Mathematics for Pathogenomics. Previously, his research has been
supported, among others, by DARPA, AFRL, AFOSR and NSF.
Dr. Brodzik is a co-author of the Birkauser book, Ideal Sequence
Design in Time-Frequency Space, Applications to Radar, Sonar and
Communication Systems.
