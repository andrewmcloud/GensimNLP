A Successful Landing: Modeling Chicagos Airspace in Real Time
If youve ever passed through Chicagos OHare Airport, you probably know firsthand that its
one of the worlds busiest. Airplanes awaiting their turn for takeoff line up on the runway like
taxicabs during rush hour. Numerous industry projections estimate that OHare will only get
busier in the future.

The strain on the airport has created the need for more capacity. Fortunately, a major effort
designed to ease congestionthe $6.6 billion, multiphase OHare Modernization Program
(OMP)is already underway. The OMP will increase the number of air traffic control towers
and runways to meet the regions current and future aviation needs.

MITRE, which operates the Federal Aviation Administrations federally funded research and
development center, has been supporting the OMP in a variety of ways. Among the most
notable: When two key stakeholders couldnt settle on the best way to work air traffic into new
routes, we devised a modeling technique for on-site testing to help them reach consensus.

Keeping Humans in the Loop
Last year, MITRE was asked to help solve a challenge that affected the airspace changes for the
OMPs first phase, explains Shane Miller, a MITRE principal software application development
engineer. Two facilitiesthe Chicago Terminal Radar Approach Control [known in aviation
parlance as C90] and the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center [known as ZAU]couldnt
agree on how southbound departures should be delivered to five new departure tracks. This was
due to lack of common understanding of each others internal operations and tools to explore
possible solutions.

These new routes were planned to not only support the OMP, but the overall redesign of
Chicagos airspace as well. The two parties needed to agree on what procedures to use, so we
set up a human-in-the-loop [HITL] evaluation to explore options for delivering aircraft on to the
five new routes, she adds.

The term human-in-the-loop refers to a modeling and simulation experiment that involves both
computers and humans using a particular application. The goals of such experiments may be
varied; in the case of air-traffic human-in-the-loop simulations, often the goal is to identify how
to efficiently manage traffic through a piece of airspace, while at the same time balancing air
traffic controller workload across multiple facilities.
Asked to Help Solve a Problem
While C90 is responsible for airspace at 15,000 feet and below, and the planes flying through it,
ZAU is responsible for the airspace above. Typically, the two facilities work together on
departures.

Both facilities tried on their own many times, over months, to agree on the best way to deliver
departures from C90 to ZAU, Miller explains. But as the deadline for a decision approached,
there was still no firm agreement on how to handle the delivery of departures. One option, for
example, was to merge and sequence departures from OHare and Midway into each of the five
new streams, while the other option was to stack OHare departures on top of Midway
departures.

With the deadline looming in a month, the FAA asked MITRE to resolve the problem. A team of
five engineers, including Miller, Thor Abrahamsen, Lee Brown, Steve Kalbaugh, and Leang
Ross, accompanied by two simulation modeling experts, Paul MacWilliams and Jeff Shepley,
traveled to Chicago with much gear in tow.

The team arrived at C90s location early on a Monday morning with a dozen computers, four
projectors, routers, cables, and everything else necessary to set up a lab in the facilitys
conference room. By Tuesday morning, ZAU and C90 employees were looking at their
respective airspace on computer screens, and simulating their roles of working on air traffic
challenges from actual, real-time radar data.
The novel experiment marked the first time an HITL evaluation of this type was taken on the
road. While MITRE has conducted such experiments at a single terminal facility alone, it was the

first time combined, interactive modeling for both a terminal and a busy center was deployed on
location.

In this case, MITREs HITL simulation allowed C90 and en route controllers to talk to one other
and control the same aircraft. The mission was to clarify which option was the best way to
handle southbound Chicago departure traffic over five departure tracks instead of three. To
make the results as robust as possible, additional air traffic controllers were summoned to the
conference room from their normal shift work to take part in the activity.

Ranking for Results

We ran five different proposed departure-track scenarios over the course of the week, so both
facilities could evaluate all proposed options for transitioning southbound departures, Miller
recalls. But by the end there was still no clear agreement between the two parties. So we had
each facility rank the five options, based on what was most important to them. The ranking
process uncovered a point of agreementboth C90 and ZAU ranked one particular scenario at
the same level of desirability.

The ultimate result? The modeling provided enough information to resolve the issue so that both
facilities were comfortable with the outcome: All five southbound departure tracks are used by
both OHare and Midway airports independently. When the timing of the departures is such that
two departures, one from each airport, would like to use the same track at the same time, the
OHare departure is stacked on top of the Midway departure.

ZAU has since followed up with MITRE, partnering with us to determine best practices for its
own airspace when running the agreed-upon departure routes.

As the OMP continues its rollout, Miller notes that the work we performed at our sponsors
location, in addition to the preparation and follow-up tasks we have conducted, should have a
positive benefit for anyone whose plane has to fly through Chicago airspace.
