Hammering Out IEDsDetecting Explosives with Biologically Inspired Research
The peculiar anatomical feature from which the hammerhead shark derives its namea
flattened cephalofoil with the eyes spaced wide on either endwas first thought by
biologists to provide the animal an advantage in sight. However, further research
determined that the sharks head provides more the benefits of a metal detector than a
pair of binoculars. Sharks (as well as several dozen other species of electro-receptive
fish) have sensory pores called ampullae of Lorenzini that allow them to detect the
electric discharges from the muscles of their prey. By spacing these pores along the width
of its head, the hammerhead increases the range of its electroreceptory powers: the sharks
are able to pick up a charge as small as a half-billionth of a volt. The far-off twitch of a
tunas tail is enough to tip the shark off to its next meal.
Now imagine providing a soldier with the same ability to locate and identify targets
though changes in the electric field. By shooting out burst of electromagnetic energy and
listening to the reflections, he could map the interiors of distant buildings, spy snipers
nestled under cover, or safely spot roadside explosives before moving into their deadly
range.
MITREs Biologically Inspired Sensing project is currently exploring that last use of
electroreceptory prowess. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are a lethal and difficultto-discover threat to our soldiersresponsible in Iraq for 63 percent of U.S. deaths.
Researchers hope to perfect the ability to detect the materials used in IEDs through a
technique called dielectric spectroscopy.
How Did the Worm Cross the Road?
Dielectrical spectroscopy involves analyzing the way an electrical charge builds up and
migrates through different materials. Different materials have different dielectric
signatures. Run an electric field through a car abandoned by an Iraqi road and you could
determine whether it contained an IED or just sand and scorpions.

The idea to harness dielectric spectroscopy to detect explosive materials first germinated
in lead researcher Nick Donnangelos imagination long ago. I have long marveled at the
ability of even simple animals to find food, avoid predators, and locate others of their
same species. When I was a child, I noticed how after a rain on a summer afternoon the
washed-up earthworms would often attempt to cross the road perpendicularly, by the
shortest route possible. I remember wondering how they could do that without even any
eyes.
As is often the case with researchers, that early fascination nudged Donnangelo along as
he pursued his studies and initial career. He found himself an expert at what he calls
unconventional sensing, the attempt to squeeze the maximum amount of information
out of an event in order to infer the technical capability of the system. This expertise
served Donnangelo well in the intelligence work he undertook early in his career. He
came to MITRE to continue plumbing the potential of unconventional sensing to serve
the public good.
Residue and Radioactivity
Donnangelo wanted to study further an observation he had made in earlier studies: that
the dielectric properties of materials emit a signature response when subjected to lowfrequency electric fields. He believed this phenomenon could help overcome the current
deficiencies in explosives detection.
Currently there are three methods primarily used in screening for explosive materials.
The first is known as The Electronic Dog Nose. This method draws air through a
polymer mesh. The mesh has tiny gaps in the shape of the molecules found in the vapors
and residue of explosive materials. Should one of those molecules fill a corresponding
gap in the mesh, the electrical properties of the mesh changes, alerting to the presence of
explosive vapors or residue in the air being tested.
The second method involves swabbing suspicious material. The swab is then run through
a mass spectrometer to test for traces of explosives.

The disadvantage to these methods is that they rely on residue and vapors. Explosive
material encased in an air-tight container would pass through these systems undetected.
Conversely, testing for explosives in an environment, such as a war zone, saturated with
explosive residue would result in a slew of false positives.
The third method does not rely on sniffing out explosives. Instead, it scans suspicious
objects with ionizing radiation and analyzes the resulting material signature. The obvious
drawback to this method is its use of radioactivity.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Dielectric spectroscopy has several advantages over these methods. Most important, it
doesnt require the presence of residue or vapors. Like the ionizing radiation method, it
simply scans the tested material and reads its signature. And rather than requiring
radioactive sources or a 150,000-volt mass spectrometer, dielectric spectroscopy relies on
relatively simple, inexpensive, low-power electronics.
Not that detecting explosive materials through dielectric spectroscopy doesnt come with
its own hurdles. For instance, because it is a capacitive measurement, dielectric
spectroscopy is employable only at relatively close ranges. And the signatures it elicits
from materials can be difficult to catalogue. Scan an object with an infrared spectrograph
and the resulting graph would be very easy to read, replete with soaring peaks and
crashing valleys. Dielectric spectroscopy, however, with its use of low-frequency electric
fields, draws out much smoother signatures, making it harder to catalogue distinctions
between materials. And even small changes in the moisture content, temperature, and
position of the material being scanned can lead to variations in the materials signature
that make exact classification even trickier.
But its not necessary for dielectric spectroscopy to be uniformly superior to other
scanning systems. This system doesnt have to be the be-all, end-all, says Donnangelo.
In fact, I dont think any system is. He considers one of the primary advantages of

dielectric spectroscopy is that it not only works where other systems fail (such as with
air-tight containers), but that the ambiguities in dielectric spectrography are uncorrelated
to conventional sensing modalities. Ideally, if youre trying to determine what
something is, and you have a number of different measurements that youre throwing at
it, you want the sensitivities for those different measurements to be orthogonalin other
words, independent of each other.
The First Steps
For Donnangelos team, the first two goals were to begin building a database of material
signatures and to conduct a successful demonstration of the technology.
Building the database is a slow, painstaking process. We need to catalogue a wide range
of signatures under a wide range of environmental situationsdifferent temperatures,
moisture levels, purity levels, material propertiesand see how distinguishable from
each other they are, explains Donnangelo. He and his team continue to piece together a
comprehensive database of materials both innocent and incendiary, the later supplied by a
relationship with the Fairfax County Bomb Squad.
Fulfilling the second goal took the team out of the laboratory and into the field. In a
system demonstration, they successfully detected explosives hidden in a car, proving that
dielectric spectroscopy could identify the spectra of explosives over a range of several
meters and in the presence of a large quantity of surrounding materials.
Bagging Explosives at the Airport
On the heels of this success, Donnangelo is mapping out the second stage of the project.
First up is to create an operational test system. Designed for soldiers in the field instead
of for researchers in the lab, the test system will be user-friendly. Three lightsred,
green, and yellowwill clue operators into the threat posed by a scanned object. To test
the system under wartime conditions, he hopes to deploy it in facilities that mimic hostile
overseas environments.

For domestic scenarios, Donnangelo is initiating the design of a stationary system that
would scan objects passing through it. The system could be deployed in such scenarios
as people moving through an airport or luggage moving along a baggage conveyor or
packages moving through a postal facility.
From his childhood observations of worms after a rainstorm, Donnangelo has forged a
new approach to safeguarding our troops. The amazing abilities of the humblest creatures
continue to inspire him. From the migration of waterfowl over thousands of miles to the
dance of bees communicating the location of flowers to electro-sensory perception in
fish, all around us there are lessons to be learned that we here at MITRE can apply to the
challenges of our sponsors.
