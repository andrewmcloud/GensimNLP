Carl Reiber
Supporting Naval Aviation from Lexington Park

With projects such as airborne networking, antisubmarine warfare, intelligence collection
reconnaissance aircraft, and the Navys unmanned combat air system, MITREs Carl Reiber and
the Naval Aviation Systems Department support their sponsor, the Naval Air Systems Command
(NAVAIR) and associated Program Executive Offices at the companys Lexington Park, Md.,
site.
When I first came to MITRE in 2003, I was working on an assortment of Navy projects here in
Lexington Park, says Reiber. Sometime thereafter, I was asked to form MITREs Naval
Aviation Systems Department. Our group has grown significantly since then and our impact has
expanded dramatically. Our staff consistently provides special value to our customers judged by
the annual survey we do.
Reiber attributes this growth in part to aligning the department to meet the customers needs.
Ive always felt that you need to pay close attention to meeting the needs of the customer, he
says. You cant be locked down in thinking about the way things have always been. You should
be focused on the way things need to be.
He continues, Clearly, our priority is to support our Naval Aviation sponsor, NAVAIR. Were
involved with a number of different Navy programs and our work encompasses a wide variety of
technical areas including unmanned vehicles, airborne networking, netted sensors, Mission
Assurance, C2 [command and control], communications, system engineering, multi-mission
helicopters, anti-submarine warfare, and research and acquisition guidance. Many of our projects
rely on staff here in Lexington Park but we also work with staff from many other MITRE
locations, including McLean [Va.], Bedford [Mass.], San Diego, and Quantico [Va.], to name a
few.
A Special Interest in Unmanned Aviation
A retired Naval Flight Officer, Reiber has a broad range of experience from his years flying
operationally, as a chief test pilot, and as a program manager in research, development, and
acquisitions for weapons. Since coming to MITRE, Reiber has also become an integral part of
MITREs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) support to our customers. It was clear to me as I
looked ahead at my departments strategic future, unmanned vehicles would be prominent in that
portfolio, he says. We [MITRE] are in a prime position to be able to support our sponsors and
further the development of military UAVs.
It is important to note, however, that this support to military UAVs is not limited to MITREs
Navy customersit includes Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps customers as well. Reiber is
one of MITREs UAV four musketeers, as they are sometimes called. They are a group of
UAV experts with experience from the different branches of the military. Reiber provides the
Naval perspective, while Michael Lavine offers the Army viewpoint, Rob Bahnij gives the Air
Force perspective, and Don Landing represents the needs of the intelligence community.

When we first met in April 2008, we talked about what we each thought the needs were in the
military UAV field, Reiber says. When you look at the potential impact of the four of us
getting together, with all four having prior military experience in the four different domains
thats very powerful. Not surprisingly, we found that by harnessing all this knowledge and
working together, we could better support all our customers.
On the Shores of the Chesapeake
While Reiber spends a significant amount of his time at MITRE headquarters and various other
sites, he is happy to call the Lexington Park area his home. I was living in the area before
coming to MITRE so I did not have to move to take the job. I was willing to, but it was nice not
to have to, he says. My wife, Nancy, and I love living near the Chesapeake Bay. A couple of
years ago we bought a 26-foot Sea Ray and we enjoy spending our free time boating. We
consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be living in such a beautiful area.

{Site sidebar} MITREs Lexington Park, Maryland site
MITREs Lexington Park site was established in 1996 after the 1993 Base Realignment and
Closure Commission resulted in the relocation of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)
and associated Program Executive Offices from Crystal City, Va., to the Patuxent Naval Air
Station in southern Maryland. The site is approximately 80 miles from the companys McLean
headquarters.
