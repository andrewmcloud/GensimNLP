One Step Ahead
MITRE simulation experiments address irregular warfare.

Irregular warfarebroadly defined as a conflict involving forces not employing traditional
methods and not belonging to the regular forces of a legally constituted statehas emerged in
the last decade as the dominant form of threat confronting the United States, both domestically
and internationally. The Somali pirate incident last April is only the latest example of this
growing national security issue.
To proactively confront these threats with action (not reaction), a new U.S. military
approach known as Operational Adaptation (OA) is currently under review. OA is a concept
that combines hardware, software, remote sensors, and networked communications that allow
our military to develop a decision and action tempo thats beyond an antagonists ability to
maintain, explains Jim Dear from the Command and Control Centers Naval Program
Directorate.
In other words, the goal is to probe, shape, and manipulate the enemy at the tactical,
operational, and strategic level. Basically, OA aims to get inside the decision-making process of
insurgents, predict what theyre going to do, and counter it with a variety of command and
control systems as well as sensors, explains Dear.

Synergistic lab
To help the military maintain the upper hand when faced by irregular warfare, the Office of
Naval Research in Arlington, Va. recently conducted a series of sophisticated simulation
experiments at the Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,

Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Experimentation Lab (NCEL). The lab is unusual in that its a
Navy- and Marine Corps-sponsored lab located on MITRE premises. That gives it a different
flavor, says Dean Zywicki, technical director of the facility.
This lab is very synergistic, says Dear, the labs project leader. Designed to host
experiments involving realistic scenarios, uniformed operators, and simulated sensors and
weapons, the lab enables sponsors to better develop integrated warfighting capabilities. MITRE
has previously supported a variety of time critical targeting and maritime domain awareness
experiments. The simulation experiments for Operational Adaptation, however, were prompted
after a project officer from the Office of Naval Research visited the lab and observed a
simulation experiment involving Navy sensors and C4I (Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, & Intelligence) tools.

Singular focus
To prepare for the initial experiment, which took place in May 2008, a data collection team from
the Information and Computing Technologies Technical Center at MITREs Command and
Control Center sat down with representatives from the Office of Naval Research to develop
objectives for the simulation experiments. Its very much sponsor-driven, says Zywicki. All
of the objectives at the SIMEXs [simulation experiments] are closely aligned with the sponsor,
which exemplifies how we act as a trusted agent for the government.
Unlike other large-scale simulation exercises, which are characterized by many
experiences running concurrently for many sponsors, NCEL is distinguished by its singular
focus. Our niche is focused experiments, working side by side with the sponsor, says Zywicki.

We did a lot of system integration and testing before the SIMEX came together,
bringing various aspects together in OA scenarios, ensuring things would work before the
warfighters arrived and the experiments began, says Dear.
To develop simulations to test new sensorssome of which didnt even exist yet,
according to Dear required substantial collaboration, including seven different cross-discipline
engineers from MITRE and three different government labs. The fact that MITRE has a lab
staffed with people experienced in running experiments, integrating simulations, and realistically
representing warfighting scenarios in a controlled environment is our distinct advantage, says
Dear.
Zywicki described their role as technical drivers at the experiments. Our contribution
came in the form of software and middleware development, as well as providing operational
research experts and data collection people who helped the sponsor understand the capabilities of
sensors, and how best to employ them, he says.

September SIMEX
A few months after the initial SIMEX, another OA SIMEX at the lab took place in September.
Basically, we took their Powerpoint diagrams and made them real, says Zywicki. We have
teams that worked side-by-side with the customer throughout the entire process, which
facilitated the development of new sensor capabilities for irregular warfare. In some cases,
operators used them in different ways than what they were designed for, and they learned new
capabilities, he says.

The experiments also allowed the sponsor to provide training for participants who didnt
have experience working with advanced technology in a Maritime Operations Center. Theres
always a training aspect on top of the overall mission, says Dear.
The two simulation experiments provided a valuable environment for Operational
Adaptation to test its concept of operations as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures. The
events also confirmed the lab as a productive training environment that could produce rapid
results. Within two weeks of the SIMEXs, we generated quick look briefs, and within two
months, we produced the final report that directly addressed the original objectives of the
experiment, says Zywicki.
This summer the Operational Adaptation sponsor is planning live demonstrations in a
field environment, which will follow up on the work performed at NCEL. The sponsor was
satisfied with the SIMEX results, says Dear.

[SIDEBAR]
The NCEL Lab
The Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Experimentation Lab (NCEL) is a Naval and Joint-sponsored lab that
supports multiple Naval and Joint commands at the MITRE campus in McLean, Va. We
conduct several SIMEX [simulation experiments] a year to address sponsor tactics, techniques,
and procedures, CONOPS [concepts of operations], and interoperability requirements, explains
Jim Dear, project leader. The lab focuses on C4ISR processes for time-sensitive targeting and
surface surveillance and tracking, and were able to address both ashore and afloat targeting
environments.
Much goes into the planning of a SIMEX, which kicks off with an initial planning
conference that synchronizes and consolidates the mission of several sponsors. Thereafter, the
CONOPS and technical architecture are developed and tested, a data collection and analysis plan

is built, and the scenarios are finalized. A typical execution schedule lasts five days, resulting in
an immediate, quick look report, which precedes the more comprehensive final report. Some
of the complex SIMEXs that have come through the NCEL Lab recently include Joint Surface
Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, and Maritime Domain Awareness.
