Program Management Committee Update
Christopher J. Hegarty, Chairman

The first RTCA Special Committee (SC-1) was established in 1946 on Simplex Crossband
Communications  108  132 Mcps. From that time until present, an additional 221 Special
Committees have been created with 18 currently active. To date, RTCA Special Committees
have produced over 300 documents of great significance to the aviation community. For
instance, on their public website the Federal Aviation Administration as of May 2009 lists 151
Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) as currently available for new approvals/production. Of
these 151 TSOs, over two-thirds incorporate by reference RTCA materials with over 60 different
documents cited. On a lighter note, the still-current TSO-C67 cites RTCA document DO-60
published in 1958 and informs the reader that it may be obtained from the RTCA secretariat for
20 cents per copy!
The Program Management Committee (PMC) is the entity within RTCA that is responsible
(since 1998) for managing Special Committee activities, including establishing new committees,
appointing chairpersons, and approving documents. The PMC currently comprises 19 members
representing a broad cross-section of the aviation community and is structured to offer a balance
between technical and operational considerations. The PMC functions as a Federal Advisory
Committee with meetings that are open to the public. Managing the SCs is a growing challenge
for the PMC as aviation communications, navigation, surveillance, and air traffic management
(CNS/ATM) systems are becoming increasingly complex and interdependent. The PMC is
implementing changes designed to render it more effective in rising to this challenge. These
changes are highlighted in the remainder of this article.
First, the PMC recently established a permanent advisory group referred to as the Integration and
Coordination Committee (ICC). The formation of the ICC was recommended by an ad hoc group
created by the PMC in June 2008 that was tasked to identify how RTCA might improve
coordination among Special Committees in the area of CNS/ATM, where appropriate. The
recommendation to create the ICC was agreed to in principle by the PMC in December 2008,
and a charter for the ICC was approved at the most recent PMC meeting in April 2009. The
scope of activities of the ICC include reviewing current and future Special Committee Terms of
Reference to ensure integration and coordination of Special Committee activities as well as
reviewing Special Committees execution of their Terms of Reference to ensure continued
integration and coordination of activities. Core ICC members have been selected based upon
relevant CNS/ATM expertise, and additionally all members of the PMC are on the ICC on an ex
officio basis.
During the last PMC meeting in April 2009, members discussed a number of additional potential
changes to improve the committees ability to effectively manage an increasingly challenging
special committee work program. A number of constructive suggestions were made in a
presentation on this topic by RTCA President and PMC member Margaret Jenny. The PMC

agreed to implement a number of these suggestions, including more frequent meetings,
reinstitution of an attendance rule, reinstatement of a Vice-Chair, and carefully managed
delegation of certain PMC duties to the ICC as appropriate.
The next PMC meeting is scheduled for July 1 at RTCA.
