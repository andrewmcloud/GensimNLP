Rob Strain
Putting Signal Processing to Work in the National Airspace

Rob Strain was a student at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., studying computer and
electrical engineering when he first heard about MITRE in 1989. As a leader of the Young
Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA), he arranged for student
AFCEA members to meet with MITREs signal processing group to visit its labs and learn about
its work. It was inspirational, he says. I was impressed by the technology research, people,
and the work MITRE was doing for the public good.

After graduation, Strain worked briefly for a small communications company before joining
MITRE in 1990. He started in MITREs Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence
federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), which is sponsored by the
Department of Defense.

I wanted to fly on large military aircraft, such as B-52s, testing very-low frequency
communications equipment, he says. There was a slow-down in the work and an opportunity
came along to continue my love of working with airplanes. That was with the Center for
Advanced Aviation System Development [CAASD], the FFRDC that MITRE operates for the
Federal Aviation Administration.

From the time he joined CAASD, Strain held a variety of jobs in the communications,
navigation, and surveillance areas of air traffic control. He was the principal investigator for
research that led to the development of MITREs Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) from
1996 to 1998. The UAT is a digital radio system that significantly increases situational
awareness for aircraft by providing real-time information about other air traffic and weather to
the cockpit. The systems have been installed in aircraft and on the ground in Western and
Southeastern Alaska through the FAA's Capstone Project. Capstone, a safety demonstration

project designed to reduce in-flight accidents and incidents, cut the airplane accident rate in
Alaska by 42 percent.

Thanks to the success of the Alaska tests, the FAA installed additional demonstration projects
along the East Coast starting in 2003 and has included UAT in the national implementation of
Automatic Dependent SurveillanceBroadcast (ADS-B) and other broadcast services. ADS-B is
the backbone of the FAAs Next Generation Air Transportation System. It uses GPS technology
to determine a plane's location, including altitude, and whether it is climbing, descending, or
turning, and broadcasting it once a second. Strain explains. This information is available to air
traffic controllers and other suitably equipped aircraft in proximity. The UAT research set the
course for my career, and its satisfying to see it find its way into the National Airspace System
(NAS).

The aviation community apparently agrees, because the UAT Technology Design Team received
the FAAs 2008 Excellence in Aviation Research Award for contributing to improving the safety
and efficiency of the NAS. At MITRE, we strive to have our ideas implemented, Strain says.
Ive been extremely fortunate to work with folks who have hit that mark.

He also has been supporting work on the development of the UAT Beacon Radio, an evolution
of the original system. The new device has potential benefits for emergency management
operations, search and rescue missions, and smaller planes unable to accommodate a heavier,
full-size UAT system. The first UAT prototype was built in 1996, weighed 35 pounds, and was
the size of a small suitcase. Today the UAT Beacon Radio is a hand-held device the size of two
decks of cards. The radio engineers in our Bedford office get all the credit for shrinking the
radio down to a compact size, says Strain. They do amazing things with microelectronics.

Improving Situational Awareness
Strain is now an associate program manager in CAASD leading systems engineering work
associated with the FAAs ADS-B program. While working on the UAT in the mid-1990s, he
was involved in the definition of the ADS-B system. He has also been a contributor to the
development and testing of two related broadcast services that deliver weather and traffic

information to pilots from FAA radars, known respectively as Flight Information Service
Broadcast and Traffic Information ServiceBroadcast. Both of these services are also available
to pilots on the UAT data link.

Among other projects, the biggest part of Strains job these days is working on the FAAs
implementation of ADS-B. Thats been pretty successful as well, he notes. In 2007, the FAA
awarded a contract to ITT Corporation, and were helping the company with its implementation,
supporting test and evaluation and future applications. Theres still quite a bit of on-going
research that well be doing about how the technology can be used.

Its challenging work like this that appeals to him, and he believes MITRE is the place to do it.
People at MITRE like to do a good solid engineering work. The environment and the caliber of
people make the work most enjoyable.

Technology Transfer and UAT
As with many MITRE prototypes, the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Beacon Radio is
available for commercial use through a nonexclusive license. MITREs Technology Transfer
Office, or TTO, enables the government and the general public to benefit from MITREs
research advances in aviation, biotechnology, nanotechnology, collaboration and visualization
tools, information security, wireless communications, and many other areas. Its part of our
public service mission to transition our inventions to sponsors or to other organizations through
licensing agreements, open source release, or publications.
