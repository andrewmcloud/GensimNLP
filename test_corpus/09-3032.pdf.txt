A Conversation with  Jim Cook
Jim Cook serves as vice president and director of MITREs Internal Revenue Service
(IRS)/Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federally Funded Research and Development Center
(FFRDC)the Center for Enterprise Modernization (CEM). In this role, he works closely with
Jason Providakes, senior vice president and general manager, in leading MITREs support of
modernization efforts at the IRS, the VA, and other civilian government agencies, including the
U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Judiciary.
Cook joined MITRE in 2004. Prior to his current position, he was CEMs executive
director for public sector revenue and finance. In this capacity, Cook partnered with the IRS to
develop the new Modernization Vision and Strategy, which guides the agencys modernization
efforts today. He was also involved in efforts to enhance the agencys IT management capability.
For his work in helping to advance improvements in civilian agency performance, Cook
has won several prestigious awards. In 1997, he became one of a handful of people from industry
to receive the IRS Commissioners Award for his leadership in helping modernize the agencys
tax administration business processes and systems. In 2007, Cook received Federal Computer
Weeks FED 100 award as one of the top 100 executives in government IT for his leadership
role assisting the IRS in setting a new IT direction.
What are your current strategic priorities?
Our focus is first and foremost on our sponsorthe Internal Revenue Serviceand the
effectiveness of the national tax system. Other priorities include helping the government improve
the oversight, regulation, and enforcement of the financial industry; detecting and pursuing illicit
financial activity; improving transparency and financial performance within the federal
government; and transforming the capabilities of other agencies whose missions directly impact
fiscal and economic decisions. For example, our work with the Census Bureau focuses on
activities that inform key economic decisions.
What initial steps are you planning?
In addition to our ongoing efforts to define a responsible and accountable role for MITRE on IRS
modernization, CEM will lead a new corporate objective focused on enhancing the effectiveness
of the federal government in regulating the financial industry. As the government looks at
financial regulatory reform, we want to be out in front and informing the governments
decisions. We will be looking to take on responsible roles to apply our systems thinking to this
complex problem.
How has the economic crisis affected your focus?
It has led us to more clearly focus the purpose and mission of CEM on the governments role and
effectiveness in the fiscal and economic sector.
What role do you envision MITRE playing in terms of financial sector regulation?
The regulatory environment is a large and complex network or system, and I believe that our
ability to bring systems thinking to a complex problem of this nature means that we can help the
government understand, organize, and transform what they do in order to be more effective at
this mission. The work that we are currently doing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to redesign the way they handle tips from the public is an example of where were
applying systems thinking to improve the regulatory capability. Its also a good example of

MITRE taking on the responsibility to identify weaknesses, design changes, and estimate the
impact of those changes.
Can you elaborate about MITRE taking on more responsible roles?
We value our focus on the mission of our sponsors. What that means to me is that we are willing
to take responsibility and be accountable for outcomes that impact mission performance. We
dont want to simply advisethats an important role, but that alone doesnt create the kind of
impact we want and our sponsors should expect.
In addition, we want to play a role in putting our advice into action. We can do that more
effectively if we are in a responsible, accountable role. This can take many forms. Having a seat
at the table when decisions are being made is one example. Another is assuming responsibility
for clearly defined customer outcomes and objectives. We are taking steps to do this in a number
of areas, including working with the IRS to define critical technical and programmatic outcomes
for MITRE to own on the modernization of the tax administration system.
What uniquely qualifies MITRE to perform this role?
First, we have no competing commercial interests. Our primary interest is in the mission results.
Second, we are willing and able to assume responsibility for outcomes that serve the
governments interests. These factors enable us to work closely with both government and
industry to achieve the best possible outcome.
Can you provide an example of our differentiated value in this domain?
Most of the administrations priorities require cross-agency and cross-domain collaboration and
integration. For example, combating financial crimes has cross-government implications, which
means that Treasury often interacts with Homeland Security, law enforcement, and the
intelligence community. While I wont speak to details here, one of the roles that we play is to
represent multiple perspectives and to bring our customers together to better understand and
apply financial information.
One of the most compelling things I remember hearing when I joined the company was a
description of MITRE as the mortar corporation. It refers to our integrator role. We bring
organizations together from private industry and government and help them work together more
effectively in the public interest.
Thought leader is an oft-heard expression at MITRE. What does it mean to you?
It means sharing an informed opinion. We have a chart that we created for our customers that
shows MITRE serving as a hub for information from academia, industry, government, standards
bodies, and other organizations. We synthesize that information and factor it into a more
thoughtful opinion, which enables MITRE as an organization to be an expert in many things. To
me, that is thought leadership.
Whats the most important leadership lesson youve learned?
To listen. I cant emphasize enough how important it is for us to listen to our sponsors and
customers, our people, and to others in our industry. Being a leader doesnt mean having all the
answers. More importantly, its the ability to listen and to hear other points of view and being
able to sort through them for the best possible solution. Thats leadership.
