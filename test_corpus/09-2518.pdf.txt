Abstract
Separation assurance is service the provided by air traffic control that keeps aircraft apart
from one another. High-density airspace provides the greatest challenge to those
responsible for separation assurance. This article describes the problem of maintaining
air traffic safety, shows the role of separation assurance within it, and enumerates the
possible dimensions of separation. The utility of the various kinds of separation, the
limitations on the use of each, and the implications of each on systematic efficiency are
described. The article concludes with a description of how upcoming changes to the
technology of air traffic control are likely to affect the job of separation assurance.
1. DEFINITIONS
1.1. Separation Assurance
Separation assurance is the service provided by air traffic control that keeps aircraft apart
from one another through the use of regulatory minimum distances between aircraft at
any given time or minimum times between aircraft at the same place. Note that
separation assurance is an engineering term, not an air traffic control term. The US
Federal Aviation Administration Order on air traffic control, (Federal Aviation
Administration, 2009a), uses phrases like provide separation, or separation is
established instead of separation assurance. The phrase separation is assured is
always in the context of before and after visual separation is applied. The NavCanada
Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations (NAV Canada, 1999) includes the phrase
separation is assured, usually in the negative. The air traffic control order in the UK
(Civil Aviation Authority, 2009) does not use assured for separation. Therefore, a
certain amount of translation must be done when applying real world air traffic control
experience to engineering requirements, and vice versa.

Separation must be assured from three things: from other aircraft, from obstacles on the
ground, and from designated regions of the airspace. Separation from airspace is
necessary when the airspace in question is used by military activities, non-aviation
airspace users such as rockets, or other uses of an airspace that would conflict with civil
air traffic. Aircraft must also remain separated from temporary restrictions on airspace,
such as those for national security or for special events.
1.2. High-Density Airspace
High-density airspace is a volume in which the number of aircraft is high enough that
active effort is required for separation. In high-density airspace other desirable features of
a system, such as flexibility in routing or user-preferred altitude profiles, are of secondary
importance to maintaining a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic, and are only
granted as workload permits. This occurs most commonly near one or more busy
airports.
Communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities are important elements in
determining the capacity of any volume of airspace. As new technology improves these
capabilities, the number of aircraft that cause airspace to be operated in high-density
fashion increases. Especially near major airports, there will be many cases in which the
airspace handles high-density traffic regardless of technological advances.
1.3. Conventions
This article will use US civil-aviation conventions, such as altitudes measured in feet. At
finer levels of detail, differences appear among countries. In places, Canadian and UK
regulations are mentioned to provide a measure of the range of variation in requirements.
Consult documents from the local air navigation service provider for the exact rules
obtaining in any particular place.
2. LAYERED MODEL OF AIR TRAFFIC SAFETY
In order to understand separation assurance, it must be seen in context. Air navigation
service providers use a defense-in-depth strategy to keep aircraft safe, which may be
thought of as nested layers. Inner layers are those concerned with the shortest time from
identification of a problem until its projected occurrence; outer layers are progressively
longer times. The shortest-time layers are the responsibility of the pilot. Longer-time
layers are the responsibility of the air traffic control or air traffic flow management. The
longest time scales are handled by policy decisions and dispatch offices. The needs of
the inner layers are more important than the needs of the outer layers, and can override
them.

2.1. See and avoid
the pilot is responsible to see and avoid other traffic (Federal Aviation
Administration, 2009b, 5-5-8a)
Ultimately, the pilot is responsible for the safety of the aircraft, so the innermost layer of
this model is controlled by the pilot. However, collision-avoidance maneuvers can be
drastic, and the workload on the pilot can be very high. A safe, orderly, and efficient
flow of traffic would be impossible to maintain in high-density airspace, when these
maneuvers are common. Therefore, the outer layers are preferable means of ensuring
safety. See-and-avoid separation from other aircraft is doubly redundant; both pilots are
involved. There is no minimum distance involved in visual collision avoidance. The
separation being protected is zero.
The see-and-avoid layer of separation has three limitations. First, the pilot can not see all
azimuths and elevations. Second, it works only in visual meteorological conditions. In
fact, visual flight rules are defined by the ability of pilots to see and avoid other traffic.
Third, as of this writing, unmanned airborne systems can not participate.
See-and-avoid is the primary means of avoiding obstacles. It can not be used for
separation from airspace. It is the backup for all outer layers of the safety model.
2.2. Airborne collision avoidance
Airborne collision avoidance systems, such as the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance
System (TCAS) on board all passenger aircraft, improve the pilots awareness of
surrounding traffic. They use a radar system that queries other aircraft transponders in
the vicinity to increase the breadth of azimuths and elevations in which other aircraft can

be detected. The pilots situational awareness therefore improves, and last-second
maneuvering is reduced. TCAS suggests maneuvers to resolve conflicts. These
resolution advisories are coordinated between aircraft, so inconsistent maneuvers are
not undertaken. Since this is a collision avoidance system, the separation being protected
is zero.
2.3. Air traffic control
Air traffic control is the heart of separation assurance. This is the first layer of safety that
protects a non-zero spacing around each aircraft. The separations to be protected can be
measured in: distance, as in the case of longitudinal, lateral, or vertical separation; time,
as in timed approaches or time-based metering; geographic location, in cases where the
aircrafts position is known within very generous tolerances; or specialized separations
based on the presence of particular navigation aids. The last two, geographic separation
and navaid separation (Federal Aviation Administration, 2009a, section 6-4-2), are
generally used in low-density airspace and will not be treated further.
Separation in any one dimension, vertical, lateral, or longitudinal, is sufficient. Aircraft
separated in one dimension may be arbitrarily close in the other two without reducing
safety. Not all dimensions of separation are available in all situations. In the absence of
surveillance, longitudinal separations of two to ten minutes are required. When such
large separation requirements are in force, the separation assurance problem quickly
becomes unmanageable. The outer layers of the safety system become the primary tool
for separation assurance.
2.3.1. Visual Separation
Around airports, the efficiency of high-density operations is improved by the use of
visual separation. If the pilot of the trailing aircraft can see the leading aircraft, and has
informed air traffic control of that fact, visual separation can be applied. No minimum
distance is necessary in this case, but the pilot must avoid the wake of the preceding
aircraft. In effect, the innermost layer of the safety model is used as a primary means of
separation assurance. Visual separation on final approach is possibly the most important
factor in arrival runway efficiency.
2.3.2. Flight Plans
All airspace above 18,000 ft, is under positive control. To enter, a pilot must inform
the air navigation service provider of the intended path of the aircraft. This intended path
is in the form of a flight plan. This plan contains an origination and destination airport,
departure routes, intermediate positions (fixes), airways, cruise altitude, and arrival
routes. In general, the flight plan is the main indication to air traffic control as to where,
and how the pilot wants to go.
2.3.3. Clearances
Air traffic controllers issue clearances to pilots. The clearance is an incremental
agreement with the controlling facility, stating how and when the aircraft can proceed
safely according to its flight plan. A clearance means that the controller has ascertained
that no other traffic will be in the way, and the aircraft may proceed without interference.
Clearances have limits; examples include clearance to a runway, on a procedure, or to a
particular point in space (fix). Clearance limits are important in the case of lost
communications: the flight path is contained, and the controller can continue to keep this

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

aircraft clear of others. An air traffic instruction is not a clearance. It is a specific action,
such as changing speed or direction of flight, that the pilot is required to undertake for
reasons of safety.
2.4. Airspace Design
The salient factor distinguishing high-density airspace is the necessity of structured
routing in three dimensions. Aircraft converging from opposite directions have very high
closing speeds, which leaves little time for tactical resolution of conflicts or spacing
aircraft into flows. The frequency of these situations is minimized by limiting the
freedom of aircraft operators to file their flight plans.
Structured routing allows procedural separation. Procedures are predefined paths for
flights to use in two or three dimensions. They simplify the process of delivering a
clearance, since there is no need to name all the points, altitudes, and speeds that
comprise the procedure. (In severe weather, when ad hoc clearances must be created to
avoid dangerous turbulence, the largest part of pilot-controller workload is
communicating the new flight path, point by point, over the radio.)
Aircraft are procedurally separated from obstacles and airspace when they are established
on a procedure. To some extent, they are also protected from other aircraft. They are
almost always laterally separated, as on an air traffic service route. Sometimes they are
also vertically separated, as on a Standard Terminal Arrival Route. Longitudinal spacing
is still to be done by the controller.
2.4.1. Air traffic service routes
Air traffic service routes, or airways, are established to simplify the flows of traffic and
thereby increase the maximum safe density of aircraft. The responsible air traffic
controller has information about the separation between airways. When two airways are
sufficiently far apart, aircraft established on two different airways are procedurally
separated. Airways are classified on the basis of the navigation system used to define
them.
Conventional navigation routes, for example Victor and Jet airways in the US, are formed
by connecting radio navigation aids. (Federal Aviation Administration, 2009c) The
precision of the navigation aid determines the lateral distance needed to separate airways,
since it relates directly to the likely lateral dispersion of flights on each airway. Near a
navigation aid, in en-route airspace, an airway is typically cleared for four nautical miles
to either side of the centerline. The precision of a radio navigation aid is expressed in
degrees of arc, so as the aircraft gets farther from the navigation aid the lateral
uncertainty in the aircraft position gets larger. The airspace that must be cleared around
the airway gets larger, if a nearby navigation aid is not available.
Area navigation (RNAV) routes on land, for example Tango and Q routes in the US,
are not required to track directly from one radio navigation aid to another, and do not
suffer from the same kind of uncertainty in position. RNAV routes are usable only by
aircraft capable of area navigation.
Required Navigation Performance (RNP) routes add to this certain constraints on the
ability of the aircraft to stay within a certain distance of the route centerline. They are
classified by lateral distance. An RNP-2 route, for example, open to aircraft certified as

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

capable of RNP-2 operations, has two 2-nautical-mile buffers on either side of the route
centerline, and is therefore roughly equivalent in spacing to a conventional route. As of
this writing, RNP routes are not eligible for procedural separation that is less than that
applied to conventional-navigation routes. Ultimately, RNP routes are expected to be
procedurally separated from one another, with a minimum of controller attention required
for aircraft on the route.
2.4.2. Sectors
Air traffic control sectors serve the critical function of limiting the size of the separation
assurance problem any particular team of controllers must resolve. A sector is composed
of a group of contiguous volumes with flat floors and ceilings. In high-density airspace,
a sector ideally is designed to make a single task very efficient. On the arrival side, such
tasks might include merging two or more flows, meeting a procedural altitude restriction,
or spacing traffic to prevent overloading a merge point later in the flow. On the departure
side, the tasks might include monitoring climbs to make sure aircraft are separated from
arrival airspace, or creating a linear flow of departures from several airports to the same
jet airway. In high-density en-route airspace, the tasks include safely merging or crossing
two airways, or blending climbing aircraft into an overhead stream.
A sector will ideally be built around a few procedures, with boundaries drawn so there is
enough airspace around each merge or restriction point to allow the controller to
maneuver aircraft to assure separation and build the required spacing. Anything outside
those boundaries is not the responsibility of the control team.
Sector boundaries are an invaluable tool for reducing the separation assurance task to
manageable proportions, but they come at a cost. Separation must be assured from the
boundary itself. In airspace where the lateral separation minimum is five miles, each
controller team must keep aircraft 2.5 miles from the boundary. Unlike other separation
tasks, however, this one is not mandatory. If the team controlling airspace on the other
side of the boundary is made aware of the situation, and agrees that it is safe, a controller
can direct aircraft close to, or even cross, the boundary. This process is called a pointout. Where the need for point-outs is common, pre-arranged coordination of a particular
maneuver may be codified in the standard operating procedures.
2.5. Flow Management
Separation assurance takes effort on the part of air traffic controllers and pilots, and when
maneuvers are involved, the maneuvering aircraft takes up airspace that might be needed
for other purposes. A situation in which many maneuvers are required can easily become
unmanageable. Flow management is used to prevent unmanageable separation-assurance
workload in another place by taking action at a time from tens of minutes to several hours
in advance.
Tactical traffic flow management begins with the recognition that two streams of aircraft
with minimum separation can not be merged. Therefore, the traffic on each upstream
airway must be spaced to a larger standard than the minimum. The exact value of this
larger standard depends on the relative amount of traffic on other airways, which may be
far from the sector in question. The spacing standard is determined by traffic flow
managers who have no responsibility for separation, so they can have a larger-scale view
of the traffic situation. Flow management is not expected to resolve the whole separation

assurance problem, merely to avoid overloading the downstream controller, so traffic
management initiatives are most effective when they are not too tightly constraining.
Strategic flow management works on longer time scales, when the number of aircraft
forecast to demand a resource exceeds the capacity of that resource. Left unattended,
such a situation would lead to an impossible separation-assurance task. Strategic flow
management relieves workload by changing the times at which aircraft take off, the
routes they fly, and the altitudes and speeds they may use. (Federal Aviation
Administration, 2009d, Chapter 17) Strategic traffic flow management decisions are
irrevocable: a ground delay once taken can not be undone. Therefore, the interests of the
airspace users should be taken into account by the flow managers, in a process called
Collaborative Decision Making in the US. (Bianco, Dell'Olmo, and Odoni, 2001)
2.6. Demand Management
At the longest time scale, a congestion problem can be identified months or years in
advance, which may lead to administrative or regulatory actions that limit the number of
aircraft using the airspace. To date, demand management is almost exclusively applied to
airports, since limiting airport traffic necessarily reduces demand for the surrounding
high-density airspace. (De Neufville and Odoni, 2002)
3. VERTICAL SEPARATION
Between two aircraft in level flight, vertical separation is the easiest way to assure
separation. If two aircraft have been assigned altitudes 1,000 feet apart, and have been
observed to be conforming to the assigned levels, they are separated. Aircraft operating
under visual flight rules are assigned altitudes ending in 500 feet. In this way, they will be
separated from all aircraft under positive control, which are assigned altitudes in round
thousands. Vertical separation can be used in radar or in non-radar environments.
Vertical separation is the most common means of assuring separation from obstacles.
The vertical separation minimum of 1,000 feet is much smaller than the separation
minimum in other dimensions. This is because pressure altimetry is the most precise
measurement of an aircrafts position. It is closely related to an aircrafts performance,
and pressure differences in the atmosphere are very stable. As atmospheric properties
such as pressure, temperature, density, and humidity change, all aircraft will respond
identically, and though they may all move up or down, their separation stays the same,
with one exception. In the terminal airspace around an airport, all aircraft calibrate their
altimeters to the air pressure reported by the dominant airport weather station. In enroute airspace, far from any dominant airport, at or above 18,000 feet, all aircraft set their
altimeters to a common, standard pressure setting. (Federal Aviation Administration,
2009b, 7-2) This conventional pressure setting is particularly important at the interface
between the high-density airspace and the high-altitude strata. In cases where the air
pressure at the airport is particularly low, the 17,000-foot level (measured from the
airport) will be higher than usual, and be less than 1,000 feet below the lowest standardsetting flight levels. In cases where this matters, procedures will be written with the
notation lowest usable flight level in place of a specified altitude.
When aircraft are not flying level, altitude separation becomes more difficult. In the
interest of safety, a climb or descent instruction is always given with a limit. Safe
operations do not assume that the communication link to the pilot will be working when

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

the time comes to stop the climb. Therefore, a climb is always given in the form, Climb
and maintain X thousand feet. In the event of lost communications, the pilot will stay at
the assigned altitude, and other aircraft can be maneuvered around it safely. When the
cleared altitude is not part of a procedure or a flight plan, they are called interim
altitudes. Interim altitudes are frequently used when an aircraft approaches a control
boundary. For example, the last instruction a tower gives to a departing aircraft usually
ends, maintain three thousand, where a channel of airspace up to 3,000 feet is reserved
by the terminal movement area for that departure. Usually, the pilot will have established
communication with the departure controller in the terminal before reaching the specified
altitude, and the aircraft will be re-cleared to a higher altitude with no perceptible break
in its rate of climb. In the rare occasions when communications have not been
established, however, safety is maintained by keeping the aircraft level, below the floor
of the departure controllers airspace.
The essential point in altitude separation of climbing or descending aircraft is that an
aircraft cleared to an altitude is considered to occupy not only the cleared altitude, but
also all the altitudes between the one it has reported leaving and the one to which it has
been cleared. Figure 2 shows an example. Aircraft A can not be cleared to the
original altitude of aircraft B until B has been observed or reported leaving its original
altitude. The reverse situation applies for descending aircraft. Stepping aircraft upward
like this creates a lot of work for both pilots and controllers, so departure procedures
rarely use altitude separation.

B
A

Figure 2. Vertical separation between two climbing aircraft
This difficulty in altitude separation is the main reason that continuous-descent arrivals
are not yet in widespread use. In a terminal movement area, arriving aircraft and
descending aircraft are constantly crossing paths. Lateral separation of crossing paths is
not possible (by definition), altitude separation is difficult, and longitudinal separation
requires long times between successive operations. In high-density airspace, where
procedures are widely used, the crossing is most efficiently handled by putting a level
segment in one of the procedures. Since arriving aircraft need to slow down and
departing aircraft wish to accelerate, the arrival procedure usually contains the level
segment. Arrival procedures without these level segments, sometimes called continuousdescent approaches are desirable for environmental reasons, but pose a difficult problem
for separation assurance. (Clarke et al., 2004)
N.B. this section assumes that both aircraft are equipped for reduced vertical separation
minima. If one is not, a 2,000-foot vertical separation requirement applies at altitudes
above 29,000 feet, and flight levels of even thousands of feet are not available to the
unequipped aircraft.

4. SEPARATION ASSURANCE WITH SURVEILLANCE
High-quality surveillance is critical to the separation assurance task in high-density
airspace. Currently, surveillance almost always means radar. In fact, the US and
Canadian air traffic control orders have entire chapters entitled Radar or Radar
Procedures. Surveillance, with supporting automation at the controllers workstation,
gives the controller near-real-time information about the positions and speeds of aircraft.
It can be used for separation assurance directly, by measuring the distance between two
aircraft positions, or indirectly, by using it to monitor conformance of the flight with its
cleared procedure.
Radar separation can be applied laterally or longitudinally. Without surveillance,
longitudinal separations requirements are expressed in time, usually two to ten minutes
between operations in any one place.
As mentioned above, aircraft are procedurally separated when the controller has observed
that the aircraft is established on a procedure. The time it takes to do this is dependent on
precision and update rate of the surveillance system.
4.1. Lateral Separation
Radars return azimuth and distance information directly, and altitude information from
the target aircrafts transponder. Measurement errors in azimuth angle imply larger
distance uncertainties at longer ranges, so the lateral separation minimum has two values.
Within a specified distance from the a single radar sensor, 40 miles in the US or 60 miles
in Canada, three miles between radar returns are sufficient for lateral separation. Outside
that range, five miles are required. In effect, a ring is established around each aircraft.
(Figure 3.) No other aircraft may be inside that ring, unless they are separated in some
other way.

Figure 3. Protected volume around an aircraft (radar separation)
The three or five mile separation standard is from other aircraft. The lateral radar
separation from airspace is half the aircraft-to-aircraft distance, so either 1.5 or 2.5 miles
must be maintained. This is the same standard that applied to a sector boundary (above).
4.2. Diverging Separation
In the high-density airspace near an airport, two aircraft are separated, if they are
observed to be on diverging headings and both have passed the crossing point of the two
trajectories. (Figure 4.) A fifteen-degree difference in heading is sufficient to establish
divergence, so three miles need not be maintained between the aircraft.

Figure 4. Aircraft on Diverging courses
One particularly important application of diverging-course separation is at the departure
end of a runway. The tower controller assigns a heading to an aircraft before it begins
takeoff, to which the pilot will turn as soon as the aircraft is airborne. If two or more
headings are available, then the second aircraft does not have to wait until the first
aircraft is three miles away before it departs, which can provide a substantial increase in
runway departure efficiency. At airports where there are two parallel departure runways,
the availability of multiple departure headings means the two runways can operate
independently.
Use of this form of separation is very common at low densities. In high-density airspace,
by contrast, the available headings off the runway may be limited by the requirements of
other approach and departure procedures. Care must be taken, in designing procedures
for high-density terminal airspace, not to preclude the use of diverging-heading departure
separation.
4.3. Longitudinal Separation
In high-density airspace, most aircraft will be cleared on procedures, which greatly
simplifies the task of lateral and altitude separation. Assuring separation in the remaining
dimension, longitudinally, forms the majority of the controllers work. Longitudinal
separation is needed between aircraft bound for the same place on the same (or a
dependent) procedure.
Longitudinal separation of departures is usually simple. The natural separation of aircraft
that depart from the same runway is sufficient to assure separation later in the flight. The
task becomes more difficult where there are many airports in a small area, each of which
may launch an aircraft bound for the same point in space.
Departing aircraft are frequently leaving an area with a three-mile lateral separation
minimum, bound for an area with a five-mile minimum. If the aircraft can be ordered so
the faster one is in front, separation is assured in the sector downstream. If not, altitude
separation, by interrupting the climb of the leading, slower aircraft, is preferable. The
least efficient way to assure separation, from the point of view of both the controller and
the pilot, is to issue lateral maneuvers so that the trailing aircraft takes longer to reach the
common fix.
Longitudinal separation of arrivals is more difficult. The primary complicating factor is
that aircraft are slowing down from their cruise speed to their landing speed. The leading
aircraft will naturally be slower than the trailing aircraft, which leads to compression of
the initial longitudinal spacing. Therefore, extra spacing must be built into the
longitudinal separation early in the arrival route. In many cases, this is a consideration

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

for all controllers handling the aircraft from the time it begins its descent until it touches
down.
The preferable technique for longitudinal separation assurance of arrivals (or cruising
aircraft) is speed control. By assigning the same speeds to the leading and trailing
aircraft, the controller can restrict compression to a few specific points in the flight,
which reduces monitoring workload. When the possibilities of speed control have been
exhausted, the next option is to change the flight path of the trailing aircraft so it flies a
longer distance. This process is called vectoring. (Examples are in Figure 5.) It is
sometimes possible to accomplish the same objective by vectoring the lead aircraft onto a
shorter path. This is most common during times of low demand in high-density airspace.
In high-density airspace, the close proximity of different procedures means that
procedures are usually not direct paths. During times of low demand, there may be no
other aircraft to separate from, so a vector that cuts short part of the procedure may not
lead to a problem.
Vectoring trades lateral control for longitudinal spacing. It requires airspace to be
available transverse to the aircrafts path, so the need for vectoring places a limit on how
close together arrival procedures may be located.

5. FUTURE CONCEPTS
The next few years are expected to bring about substantial changes in the current
separation assurance task. Programs such as the Single European Sky and the Next
Generation Air Transportation System in the US are bringing modern technology to bear
on the inefficiencies of the process. These programs have countless differences, but four
common themes: improved information sharing; improvements to communications,
navigation, and surveillance; closed-loop control; and changes to roles and
responsibilities. As of this writing, these concepts are all at early stages of development;
many still require basic research.
5.1. CNS improvements
Communications, navigation, and surveillance improvements work together. The current
system relies on voice communications, which limits the amount of information that can
easily be exchanged between pilots and controllers. Digital data communications will
enable controllers to know much more about a pilots intent, and pilots to receive much

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

more complex clearances. Global navigation satellite systems mean that procedure
design need not be confined by the locations of ground-based radio navigation aids, and
aircraft can follow instructions much more precisely. Dependent surveillance, in which
the aircraft avionics communicate their own estimate of the position of the aircraft, means
that the concept of distance from a radar sensor loses its importance.
The distinction between airspace with a three-mile separation minimum and a five-mile
separation minimum vanishes when dependent surveillance is used. This means that enroute airspace can be designed to closer tolerances, but also that a large portion of the
problem of separation assurance for departures from high-density airspace is no longer
relevant.
Reduced separation minima are widely anticipated in a system with modern
communications, navigation, and surveillance. Particularly near airports with closelyspaced parallel runways or crossing runways, reduced separations can have substantial
benefits to efficiency. However, the historical relationship between infrastructure and
separation minima is not well understood. Without such a cause-and effect-relationship,
it is difficult to establish the safety level of reduced separation.
With improved navigation and procedures designed to take advantage of it, time-based
separation loses its disadvantages relative to distance-based separation. Clearances that
require an aircraft to pass a specific point at a specific time can be used more extensively,
which brings tactical traffic-flow management techniques to bear on separation
assurance. Area-navigation or RNP procedures, with smaller required spacing, can help
to achieve maximum throughput during peak demand or to support nominally efficient
vertical profiles during non-peak periods.
5.2. Four-dimensional trajectory-based operations
As mentioned above, procedures simplify the separation assurance task in two or three
dimensions. Adding the time dimension to a procedure enables many more uses of the
limited airspace available in the high-density terminal. Four-dimensional trajectorybased operations imply that aircraft do not have to be separated from airspace, just
because that airspace may be needed for another purpose. The containment area around
the four-dimensional trajectory becomes the only airspace that needs to be protected,
which would allow shorter paths or better speed and altitude profiles.
The key to this kind of operation is a closed-loop clearance, with automated conformance
monitoring. Instead of a vector off of an arrival procedure, which obliges the controller
to return to the aircraft to give another turn back onto the intended flight path, a closedloop instruction contains both turns in a single clearance. This removes the uncertainty in
the time at which the aircraft will return to its intended flight path. When the whole
future trajectory of the aircraft is known to the controllers automation system, all
trajectories in the vicinity can be probed for conflicts well in advance. Upon receipt of
the pilots response, the aircraft is considered established on the new trajectory, and the
current need to observe the aircraft for several revolutions of the radar antenna is no
longer necessary.
Improved conformance monitoring and conflict probe, in essence, expands the idea of
procedural separation to almost all operations except emergencies. Procedural separation
with minima no larger than those required for distance-based radar separation has the

potential to greatly simplify the workload imposed on the controller by high traffic
densities.
5.3. Roles and Responsibilities
The two innermost layers of the model in Figure 1 are the pilots responsibility. Outer
layers are the responsibility of air traffic controllers and traffic flow managers, with one
exception: visual-separation clearance, where the pilot is involved in the air traffic
control layer. Many proposals for the future system involve broadening this exception.
5.3.1. Cockpit-centered separation assurance
Airborne collision avoidance systems contain a display of the traffic around each aircraft.
(Figure 6.) Improvements to this display may support the use of delegated separation
responsibility, like a visual clearance, in many more situations. One use may be to
support visual separations in weather conditions that do not currently permit it, with the
cockpit display serving as an enhancement to visual identification of other traffic.
Another use is in the form of relative clearances, where a trailing pilot is instructed to
maintain a given spacing behind a leading aircraft.

Figure 6. Cockpit display of traffic information
5.3.2. Ground-based separation assurance
With more-reliable navigation and surveillance, and time-based procedures making sure
trajectories are free of conflicts with airspace or other aircraft, the focus of the air traffic
controllers attention changes. Much less work is associated with the routine tasks of
delivering radio frequency changes, issuing procedural altitude restrictions, and watching
to make sure instructions are carried out. Far more attention is likely to be dedicated to
handling exceptions to the standard procedures.
In the current system, when a difficult situation is caused by one or more aircraft out of
conformance with standard procedures, the situation is dealt with by traffic flow
management initiatives that limit the traffic into the congested area. These are not
flexible, and can lead to deviations from schedule that are much larger than necessary. In

 The MITRE Corporation. All rights reserved.

a system with automated conformance monitoring and conflict resolution, complicated
separation-assurance situations may be handled with much smaller, targeted trajectory
changes.
5.4. Information Sharing
Many of the rules governing separation assurance are based on the assumption that
information about system status is limited. Modern communications networks make this
assumption unnecessarily constraining. If every air traffic controller has the same
information, then solutions to congestion problems need not be confined to a single
sector. When more space is available to resolve a problem, smaller maneuvers suffice.
The quality of problem resolutions can also be improved by information sharing. An
aircraft currently has a flight plan, which is amended by controllers as the situation
changes. A more flexible concept would be to distinguish three versions of the flight
plan: the aircraft operators preference; the aircraft intent; and the current clearance.
Digital communication would enable the automation system to capture the essence of the
agreements between controller and pilot (currently made verbally), and update the
systems projections appropriately. When the users preference and intent are known,
maneuvers or delays to avoid a congestion problem can be ranked according to their
desirability to both controllers and users, and thereby reducing the chance that a solution
to one congestion problem is the cause of another problem elsewhere.
