The Ex-Files: Innovation Exchange 2009
Once a year, MITRE staff, sponsors, and customers come together to share the research of the
MITRE Innovation Program. Findings are presented, connections are made, and new ideas are
sparked. The 2009 Innovation Exchange was no exception: Eighty-nine exhibits in 15 investment
areas were showcased on the McLean campus from May 5-7.
In past years, the Innovation Exchange was held outdoors in a large tent on the MITRE grounds.
This years format featured projects exhibited on a rotating schedule in the MITRE-1 building.
According to Steve Huffman, vice president and chief technology officer, the recent successes of
mini-Exchanges at sponsor sites influenced this years format. In speaking to some of our
sponsors about this years event, I believe they were better able to focus on technology areas and
specific technologies that could be of use in their mission areas, he said. Smaller venues offer
more in-depth exploration of our technology.
Technology Transfer: Where the Lab Meets the Marketplace
From laser shields to aircraft flight modeling, MITRE technical staff members have patented
numerous technologies and processes that have made sponsors and customers more effective.
With the help of the Technology Transfer Office (TTO), MITRE-created work is patented,
published, licensed to commercial companies, and transitioned to the government.
Each year at the Innovation Exchange, visitors can learn more about the work of the Technology
Transfer Office, see some of the TTOs recent success stories, and discuss possible licensing or
transfer of MITRE-created technologies.
The TTO booth featured a number of technologies that are available for licensing. We invited a
good part of the business community to the Innovation Exchangethey represent funding
sources, entrepreneurs, and service providers, said Ray Dizon, technology transfer director. In
some cases, I can help them identify which technologies might complement what they already
offer. In others, we might have some visitors interested in startups, and they can assemble a team
to license the technology from us.

Its great for me to have the chance to talk to the principal investigators, get caught up,
and see these projects evolve. Theres a lot of energy in this program, and thats key for
us in staying ahead of the curve.

This event is an excellent opportunity to meet the leaders of MIP projects and discuss
how their work might apply to your own activities.

The Innovation Exchange is valuable for making connections both inside and outside of
MITRE. It allows principal investigators to discover new applications of their work for
different sponsors, and to explore synergies with other researchers.

I found that the new Innovation Exchange format was a better use of principal
investigator time, and its allowing the customers and sponsors to come through in a
more focused manner.

MITRE tends to focus more on engineering, but weve tried to carve out our own little
niche. I think weve been successful so farwe have several bio programs, and weve
been able to gear them into areas to which the sponsor can relate.
- Juan Arroyo, CIIS
Our team is exploring the algorithms for the NextGen Collision Avoidance System. The
Innovation Exchange is a valuable forum to disseminate our research to MITRE
colleagues from different centers, and to look for opportunities to cross-pollinate with
their research.
