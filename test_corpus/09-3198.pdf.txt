What is Nanotechnology?
Nanotechnology is:
 Engineering on the
incomprehensibly small
molecular scale

Example
Nanomemory/nanosensor
prototype that fits on
a human cell

 Putting molecules where

we want them, by design,
to build entire systems
of macroscopic extent, e.g.
 Powerful new nanocomputers

and nanosensors
 Smaller, more efficient
nano-enabled power sources
 Materials with novel properties
 Advanced medical therapeutics

 Very Interdisciplinary

Completed in 2005 by Govt.
consortium including MITRE

1 nanometer (nm) = 1 billionth of a meter 10 atomic diameters
1 micron (m)
= 1 millionth of a meter

Interdisciplinary R&D in Nanotech Has Led
to Many Important Student Technical Projects
Students investigators have:
 Helped write fundamental review
articles surveying nanotech
 Designed and fabricated parts for

tiny, ant-sized robots
 Invented new molecular circuits
 Invented processes to assemble

and sort ultra-tiny structures
 Performed proof-of-principle

experiments in our nanotech lab
 Helped design and set up

lab apparatus for testing
nanotech-enabled batteries
 Helped discover new laws of

physics

As a result of these groundbreaking efforts, students have
published journal articles, gained patents, & won corporate awards

Some of Our H.S. Student Investigators Have
Entered Papers in Science Talent Search Contest
 16 entries in STS from MITRE

student investigators since 1989
 All have gone on to be at least

Semifinalists in STS (Top 300)
 9 have been named Finalists

(Top 40 in STS Contest)
 3 students have been named

Top 10 winners of contest
 2 in March 1999
 1 in March 2009
 Some students who were not judged

as highly in contest went on to
publish work in journals or to gain
patents for their work
Contests & awards not our objective. Key reason we support STS entries:
this contest motivates young students to (learn to) write a scientific paper

then answer them with precision
 Emphasis on attention to detail in observation and, especially,

attention to anomaly
 Emphasis on research systematics
 Thinking for the long term
 Strong background research, record keeping, & organization
 Great emphasis on the scientific method, its meaning, & practice
 Very great emphasis on clear, precise oral & written articulation

of all aspects of students work (underlying rationale, objectives,
approach, method, & results of technical efforts)

Thoughts on How Teachers Can Interact
with Industry to Place Students for Mentorship
 Reach out to corporate human resources staff, but also

should build partnerships with hiring managers
and technical staff
 Try to see the hiring process from point of view of those

who might hire students
 What do they value in an employee?
 Select and propose for placement only those students

who truly meet employers criteria
 Build your reputation with industry partners by working

to ensure 100% student successes after placement
 Be aware that success is measured one student at a time

Thoughts on How Teachers Can
Guide Students Toward Technical Placements
 In working with students, focus on
 Excellence in basic technical and communication skills,
 ...but also independent thinking and maturity
 Ensure that students have some training in:
 Writing inquiries to prospective employers;

examples may help
 Interviewing for a technical position
 Encourage each student to think about how they can help

a potential employer, not just how employer can help him/her
