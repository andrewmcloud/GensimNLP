Purpose
 Analyze and quantify the impact the Data
Communications Program on En Route OEs

Background
 MITRE Center for Advanced Aviation System
Development (CAASD) has conducted OE
analysis since 2004 for both En Route and
Terminal domains

 Analyses include
 Trend analysis by variety of factors including
facility, position, time on position, number of
aircraft controlled, and training
 Identification of outliers
 Causal factors

 Impact of selected future programs on OEs

Methodology
 Conducted detailed causal factor analysis
 692 Fiscal Year 2005 (FY05) En Route OEs for 20* Air Route
Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) done in 2006

 Rotating teams consisting of a former controller and an
analyst reviewed the narrative text for each OE
 Achieved consensus on involvement of over 40 unique
factors that could cause or contribute to an OE; Categories
of factors include:
 Communications
 Display and Interpretation
 Practices and Procedures
 Coordination/Staffing

* Excludes Anchorage ARTCC

Methodology (continued)
 Scored factors from zero to three where zero meant not
present and three meant the factor was causal to the OE
 An OE can have multiple causal factors

 Impact of selected future programs on OEs was based on
 Operational Concept as defined at the time of the analysis
including lead time and phase of flight
 Judgment of SME and analysts

 Aircraft involved in OE (e.g., in the case of Data
Communications, low-end General Aviation aircraft might not
invest in Data Communication equipment)
 OE Mitigation Likelihood Scale
 No impact
 Low probability of preventing OE
 Good probability of preventing OE
 High probability of preventing OE

OE Definitions
 OE Definition Changes
 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) changed the definition
of an OE and associated severity classifications with three
notices between February and June 2007
 Analyses are based on the original definitions which was in
effect in FY05 and FY06

 Operational Error from 7210.56C, 5-5-1: An occurrence
attributable to an element of the air traffic system in which:
1. Less than the applicable separation minima results between 2 or
more aircraft, or between an aircraft and terrain or obstacles (e.g.,
operations below minimum vectoring altitude (MVA); equipment /
personnel on runways), as required by FAA Order 7110.65 or other
national directive; or
2. An aircraft lands or departs on a runway closed to aircraft
operations after receiving air traffic authorization.
3. An aircraft lands or departs on a runway closed to aircraft
operations, at an uncontrolled airport and it was determined that a
NOTAM regarding the runway closure was not issued to the pilot as
required.

Severity Index (SI) Classification
(used by FAA during analysis period)

 FAA tracks the degree of seriousness (severity) of an OE
where Category A and B are considered the most severe
 Factors* used to determine SI Classification include:
 Vertical and Horizontal Separation
 Closure rate
 Flight Paths
 Controlled/Uncontrolled

 OE SI classification is based on total points:
 Category A: 90 points and above
 Category B: 40 to 89 points and uncontrolled
 Category C: 40 to 89 points and controlled

 Category D: 39 points and below

* Point values associated with these factors can be found in Appendix

Communication-Related OEs
 Types of communications-related OEs include:
 Readback/hearback
 Issued different altitude than intended

 Issued control instruction to wrong aircraft
 Transposed call sign
 Failure to update data block
 Several analyses indicate that approximately 20% of all En Route
OEs are communications related
 23% found in CAASD analysis of 680 OEs in 2002 and 2003
 20% found in 1,359 OEs in FY04 and FY05 based on preliminary
information
 23% of all operational errors at Miami Center for the five year
period from January 1998 to September 2003 could have been
avoided by [data link]  Miami ARTCC

 Communication-related OEs tend to be higher severity

Data Communication Impact on
En Route OEs
 Communication-related OEs accounted for 30
percent of En Route OEs in FY05

 Data Communications
estimated to mitigate*
23 percent of En Route
OEs

FY05 En Route OEs

Remaining
OEs

 Includes 32 percent of
more severe OEs

High Severity
OEs

32% of High Severity
Operational Errors
could be prevented
with Data Communications

Data Communications could prevent
over 23% of all En Route OEs

 Caveat: analysis uses OE and
severity definitions in use in FY05

*Includes those OEs with good or high probability of mitigating the OE
