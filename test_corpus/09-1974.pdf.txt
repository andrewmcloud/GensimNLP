CLEAR SKIES FOR NEXTGEN
Looking up at a sleek new aircraft crossing a blue sky may lead you to daydreaming about flying
to Las Vegas to try your luck or hoping that the birthday present you overnighted to your Aunt
June arrives in time. But when MITREs Gregg Leone looks skyward, he anticipates a future
where advances in aviation technology and air traffic management enable an unprecedented
increase in air transportation options for the public, cargo shippers such as FedEx and UPS, and
the military.
According to Leone, a technical director for MITREs Center for Advanced Aviation System
Development (CAASD), the next two decades will provide sky watchers with a lot more to
contemplate. Even with the recent economic doldrums, air travel is expected to double according
to some estimates. Passenger traffic isnt the only factor. Theres also overnight delivery, which
is no longer a luxury but a necessity, forcing shippers air fleets to grow. And an increasing
number of unmanned aircraft will take flight on missions of science, law enforcement, and
homeland defense.
But how can the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prepare the air traffic management
system to accommodate this increased traffic while still maintaining our national airspaces
admirable safety record?
Says Leone, MITRE is working with the FAA and other federal agencies to transform the
national airspace system to meet the future needs of air travel. The FAA looks to us to generate
new concepts, develop new standards, and find new solutions to evolve and improve our national
airspace system.
The Next Generation of Aviation Technology
These new concepts, standards, and solutions are known collectively as the Next Generation Air
Transportation System, or NextGen. One of the critical principles of NextGen is to make
airspace more efficient by enabling planes to fly routes that are more direct and more tightly
spaced. Margaret Gomes, program manager for MITREs NextGen Evolution and Integration

team, says, By 2025, NextGen will change how airplanes, airspace, and airports operate and are
managed in the United States.
Imagine this future: Aircraft trajectories for the entire airspace are computed by both groundbased and airborne flight management systems and can be quickly modified based on changing
weather or traffic flow patterns. Communications between the ground and the cockpit are
enhanced by digital data exchange. Each pilot can see digitized data about neighboring aircraft
and surrounding terrain on a head-up display system, allowing the pilot better-than-visual
situational awareness.
To achieve this future, NextGen must overcome the problem of older technology dictating the
placement of air routes. For decades, air routes have been determined by the location of groundbased navigation beacons. Aircraft may not fly out of the range of these navigation aids, so air
routes are often inflexible and inefficient.
Two of the concepts critical to the NextGen systemArea Navigation (RNAV) and Required
Navigation Performance (RNP)have been refined in MITREs air traffic management
laboratories in McLean, VA, and have already been tested in real world operations. RNAV and
RNP use advanced satellite-based navigation and procedures that allow equipped aircraft to fly
more direct routes into and out of airports, enhancing efficiency of arrivals and departures while
saving time and fuel.
With more precise and accurate paths, more lanes can be built into the same limited airspace,
creating more capacity where we need it. Whats more, the increased flexibility in air routes and
the increased accuracy in satellite-guided approaches will open up runways across the country
previously inaccessible to certain aircraft. RNAV and RNP will make more room for aircraft in
the air and on the ground.
Precision Tracking
More traffic in the air will require that individual aircraft present a more accurate accounting of
their position to air traffic managers and each other. MITRE, in cooperation with several other

organizations, has provided the means for such an accounting with the Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). ADS-Bs development recently earned the most prestigious
honor in aviation: the Robert J. Collier Trophy.
A planes ADS-B system broadcasts precise data in real time about the planes location, speed,
and altitude. This increased situational awareness will allow air traffic controllers to place air
routes in tighter proximity to each other while still remaining within required safety standards. It
will also allow pilots to keep a closer eye on neighboring aircraft in case of emergencies. In
addition, through its broadcast capabilities, ADS-B will give pilots access to critical weather
services, terrain maps, and flight information services, Leone says.
Safety First
The massive amounts of data zipping from satellite to plane to air traffic control in the NextGen
future will require the FAA to modernize its communications infrastructure as well. MITRE is
working with the FAA to construct a high-capacity air-ground digital data communications
system to increase its capacity for data transmission. Reducing the pilot and controller voice
communications workload will increase safety by minimizing the risk of possible
miscommunication, says Leone.
In developing NextGen, safety is the top priority. MITRE applies proven safety assessment
methods every step of the way. For many of its analyses, MITRE can now draw on the Aviation
Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) database, an extensive repository of aviation
information, including pilots reports and black box readings. MITRE uses ASIAS as part of its
collaboration with the aviation community to develop new and improved solutions in air safety.
The I-Team
Coordinating the development of these technologies and their integration into the national
airspace system has required close cooperation between the FAA and MITRE. To facilitate this
cooperation, the FAA has created an integration and implementation team populated by experts
in such domains as communications, navigation, surveillance, weather, security, and net-centric

DIGEST
operations. MITRE, in turn, has formed a complementary integration team, called The I-Team,
staffed with its own highly regarded domain experts to work hand-in-hand with the FAA.
The I-Team has been creating operational scenarios involving NextGen concepts to ensure that
MITRE and the FAA have a common understanding of the technological and procedural
improvements needed for the updated national airspace system and of the interdependencies of
those advanced concepts.
Many Partners
While MITRE has a fruitful history of working in tandem with the FAA, Gomes points out that
the FAA is not the only agency with a stake in NextGens success. In 2003, Congress enacted
the Vision 100Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. That act chartered the Joint
Planning and Development Office to plan and implement NextGen as a joint initiative of the
Departments of Transportation, Defense, Commerce, and Homeland Security, as well as of
NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
MITRE has assisted the Joint Planning and Development Office since its inception in assessing
research, developing implementation plans, and setting development priorities for NextGen.
MITRE also provides the office with expertise in air traffic management, aviation security,
meteorology research, net-centric operations, and business and portfolio analysis, to cite a few
areas of technical engagement.
MITREs work with NextGen is the latest chapter in our historic role in the evolution of the
national airspace system. Through engagement with the FAA and other agencies in the Joint
Planning and Development Office on evolving technologies, procedural changes, and updated
policies, MITRE will continue to assist that transformation in order to keep our nations citizens,
goods, and aspirations soaring high and safe.
