MITRE Digest
The Largest Upgrade in AWACS History
The E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft is one of the most
successful airborne command and control battle management platforms in the U.S. Air Forces
history. Its proven itself in allied operations from the Gulf War, through the Balkans, to the
present day in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, its going through its most comprehensive upgrade
since it was fielded in 1977.
The upgrade, known as Block 40/45, completely replaces the old AWACS mission computers
and operator consoles that have provided the on-board data processing and the user interface for
the last 30 years. A new open system architecture uses network servers in a user-friendly
operating environment. The vastly improved computing power helps automate what used to be a
manually intensive workload for the AWACS operators.

Wide Range of Work Over the Years
From the start, MITRE has been the AWACS systems engineer, under a contract with the USAF
Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford, Mass. Says MITREs Daniel C.
Holtzman, the program office deputy chief engineer for the AWACS Block 40/45 program: Our
work has included everything from radar analysis to evaluating tracking performance, to putting
commercial-off-the-shelf [COTS] computers in an aircraft thats made to military specifications.

For the USAF upgrade, we used a COTS hardware computing infrastructure, which required
re-designing the entire ground systems and maintenance concepts, says Holtzman. When we
use COTS equipment, we have to qualify it to work in a military aircrafts environment or
provide a safe enclosure so it can meet military standards. For example, military hardware must
withstand higher levels of vibration and shock than most commercial hardware. And because the
E-3 refuels in midair, any added COTS equipment must operate without igniting a potentially
explosive atmosphere.

For operators on the AWACS E-3, the all-new mission software provides enhanced tracking, and
new battle management tools to process and manipulate data. A new user interface reduces the
operators workload so they can focus on the mission and dont have to manually integrate data
and operate the computers. The new software with the COTS-based architecture also lays the
foundation for integrating a future airborne network connection to the aircraft in 2012, allowing
for more robust network-centric operations in the future.
Block 40/45 also includes an upgrade to the electronic support measures (ESM) passive
surveillance capability for expanded target identification. ESM is a listening and detection
system that analyzes radio signals it receives from an adversary. This enables the AWACS to
detect, identify, and locate electronic transmissions from ground, airborne, and maritime sources.
Using the ESM system, mission operators can determine radar and weapon system type.
A Showcase for Acquisition Reform
The systems engineering work was done by a small core team says Holtzman. When required,
we could easily access the deep levels of expertise available throughout MITRE such as
mechanical engineering, electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility, sensors,
and information assurance.
The MITRE team ensured that the Block 40/45 system seamlessly integrates into the larger
USAFs open architecture, while providing the basis for smooth integration of future systems
and enhancements. The team supported the program through all phases of systems engineering,
from the initial requirements in the design phase to operational test and evaluation. The team also
had to make recommendations on requirements that changed over the years because of budget
constraints.
Despite the fact that AWACS has flown for more than three decades, the upgrade maintains the
E-3s status as a state-of-the-art flying platform for intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. This was done with strict cost controls that affected how we could do things,
explains Holtzman. For example, we had to figure out how to test a system that has three
million lines of software code plus lots of functionality, yet there was only enough money to test
one fifth of the functionality via traditional flight testing. To do that, we structured the Block

40/45 acquisition program to be simulation-based, enabling us to verify simulation and modeling
tests with flight data.
In cases where problems arose in the test and verification phase, MITRE analyzed the problems,
figured out the root causes, and proposed options. We made sure to identify the solution for the
sponsor so that it could implement them, says Holtzman. Whenever possible, we didnt give
just a single point answerwe gave a range of options that identified the risk and cost associated
with the problem and multiple solutions so that the Air Force could choose the best one. We
made sure the right engineering rigor was presented in the design analysis so that the best
technical solution could be chosen given all the parameters.

International Upgrades
MITRE also supports international partners that have purchased the E-3 AWACS. Like the
USAF AWACS, their existing mission computing and display systems are antiquated - its
1970s era technology, says Bob Fedrick, MITREs AWACS department head. If you want
additional capabilities in your mission system, you have to upgrade the infrastructure in advance
of, or in conjunction with, those new capabilities.

The French AWACS program is going forward with an equivalent Block 40/45 mission
computing and displays upgrade, plus a next generation Identification Friend or Foe upgrade.
The Japanese Air Self Defense Force has expressed strong interest in upgrading its AWACS
mission computing system and adding an EMS passive detection capability. And the Saudi
AWACS program has also expressed interest in improving its mission computing systems.
A successful mission systems test flight program in November 2008 allowed Block 40/45 to get
approval for a low-rate initial production decision. We see Block 40/45 maintaining the E-3 as
the premier command and control platform for the USAand its international partners for many
years, concludes Holtzman.

The E-3s radar dome is 30 feet in diameter and six feet thick. It
contains a radar subsystem that permits surveillance of the Earths
surface up into the stratosphere, over land, or water. The radar has a
range of more than 200 miles for low-flying targets and farther for
aerospace vehicles flying at medium to high altitudes.
